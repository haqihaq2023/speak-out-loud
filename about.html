<p>Why does Speak-Out-Loud exist?</p>
<ul>
<li>Islamic Audiobooks are hard to find.</li>
<li>Especially for classics.</li>
<li>With AI becoming more accessible, text to speech becomes a great alternative to large audio files.</li>
<li>The books here are parsed into a format suitable for TTS systems to read.</li>
<li>I recommend using the Microsoft Edge browser. TTS is offered on Windows, Mac, IOS and Android.</li>
