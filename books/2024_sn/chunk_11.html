<p>In this biography of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, we see a detailed account of his diplomatic efforts through letters sent to various rulers, inviting them to embrace Islam. One of the most notable exchanges is with Negus, the Christian king of Abyssinia. Prophet Muhammad's letter emphasizes the monotheistic nature of Islam and acknowledges Jesus as a revered prophet. Upon receiving the letter, Negus expresses his esteem for Islam and acknowledges Prophet Muhammad's divine mission, ultimately expressing his faith and respect through his response. While Negus aligns himself with the Prophet's call, his successor’s spiritual stance remains uncertain.</p>
<p>The narrative also covers communications with other influential leaders. The Prophet wrote to Muqawqas, the vicegerent of Egypt, urging him to accept Islam. Despite recognizing the integrity of Muhammad's message, Muqawqas refrains from converting, choosing instead to send gifts to the Prophet, including Maria, who would later bear the Prophet's son, Ibrahim. Simultaneously, the letter to Chosroes, the Persian emperor, resulted in an adverse reaction, leading to a series of political maneuvers that eventually saw the demise of Chosroes and the conversion of his successor's governor in Yemen. This illustrates the complexity and varied receptions of the Prophet’s peaceful calls to Islam across different regions and cultures.</p>
<p>This diplomatic mission underscores the nascent Islamic state's attempts to expand its spiritual reach while engaging with existing sovereignties respectfully. Not all encounters met with success; for example, Hercules of Rome, though intrigued by the Prophet’s message, ultimately did not convert. These documented efforts capture the Prophet’s resolve and the strategic peacefulness of his interactions, reflecting a key aspect of his leadership and the expansive vision of bringing the universal message of Islam to all corners of the known world at that time. Through these letters, the Prophet achieved varying degrees of influence, setting a precedent for intercultural and interfaith dialogues.</p>
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>"The matter of Ibn Abi Kabshah (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh]) has become so prominent that even the king of Banu Al-Asfar (i.e. the Romans) is afraid of him." So I continued to believe that Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] would be victorious, till Allâh made me embrace Islam." The king did not embrace Islam — for it was differently ordained. However, the Muslim envoy was returned to Madinah with the felicitations of the emperor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On his way back to Madinah, Dihyah Al-Kalbi was intercepted by people from the Judham tribe in Hasmi, who looted the presents sent to the Prophet [pbuh]. Zaid bin Haritha at the head of five hundred men was dispatched to that spot, inflicted heavy losses on those people and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and a hundred women and boys. The chief of Judham who had embraced Islam filed a complaint with the Prophet, who gave a positive response to the former’s protest and ordered that all the spoils and captives be returned.</p>
<h2>A Letter to Mundhir bin Sawa, Governor of Bahrain</h2>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] dispatched ‘Al-‘Ala’ bin Al-Hadrami to the governor of Bahrain, carrying a letter inviting him to embrace Islam. In reply, Al-Mundhir bin Sawa wrote the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh]! I received your injunctions. Prior to this, I read your letter, which you wrote to the people of Bahrain extending to them an invitation to Islam. Islam appealed to some of them and they entered the fold of Islam, while others did not find it appealing. In my country, there live Magians and Jews, and therefore you may inform me of the treatment to be extended to them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] wrote the following letter in reply to his:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 
From Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Mundhir bin Sawa. 
Peace be on you! I praise Allâh with no associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. 
Thereafter, I remind you of Allâh, the Mighty, the Glorious. Whoever accepts admonition, does it for his own good. Whoever follows my messengers and acts in accordance with their guidance, he, in fact, accepts my advice. 
My messengers have highly praised your behaviour. You shall continue in your present office. Give the new Muslims full chance to preach their religion. I accept your recommendation regarding the people of Bahrain, and I pardon the offences of the offenders; therefore, you may also forgive them. 
Of the people of Bahrain whoever wants to go on in their Jewish or Magian faith, should be made to pay Jizya (poll-tax)."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Letter to Haudha bin ‘Ali, Governor of Yamama</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 
From Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Haudha bin ‘Ali. 
Peace be upon him who follows true guidance. Be informed that my religion shall prevail everywhere. You should accept Islam, and whatever under your command shall remain yours."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The envoy chosen was Sulait bin ‘Amr Al-‘Amiri, who after communicating his message, carried back the following reply to the Prophet [pbuh]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Faith, to which you invite me, is very good. I am a famous orator and poet, the Arabs highly respect me and I am of account among them. If you include me in your government, I am prepared to follow you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The governor then bestowed a reward on Sulait and presented him with clothes made of Hajr fabric. Of course, he put all those presents in the trust of the Prophet [pbuh]. </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] did not accept Haudha’s demand. He usually turned down such peremptory tone, and would say that the whole matter was in the Hand of Allâh, Who gave His land to whoever He desired. Gabriel later came with the Revelation that Haudha had died. The Prophet [pbuh], in the context of his comment on this news, said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yamama is bound to give rise to a liar who will arrogate Prophethood to himself but he will subsequently be killed." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply to a question relating to the identity of the killer, the Prophet said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is one of you, followers of Islam."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Letter to Harith bin Abi Shamir Al-Ghassani, King of Damascus</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 
From Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Al-Harith bin Abi Shamir.<br />
Peace be upon him who follows true guidance, believes in it and regards it as true. I invite you to believe in Allâh Alone with no associate, thenceafter your kingdom will remain yours."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shuja‘ bin Wahab had the honour of taking the letter to Harith, who upon hearing the letter read in his audience, was madly infuriated and uttered: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who dares to dispossess me of my country, I’ll fight him (the Prophet),"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and arrogantly rejected the Prophet’s invitation to the fold of Islam.</p>
<h2>A Letter to the King of ‘Oman, Jaifer, and his Brother ‘Abd Al-Jalandi</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 
From Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah to Jaifer and ‘Abd Al-Jalandi. 
Peace be upon him who follows true guidance; thereafter I invite both of you to the Call of Islam. Embrace Islam. Allâh has sent me as a Prophet to all His creatures in order that I may instil fear of Allâh in the hearts of His disobedient creatures so that there may be left no excuse for those who deny Allâh. If you two accept Islam, you will remain in command of your country; but if you refuse my Call, you’ve got to remember that all your possessions are perishable. My horsemen will appropriate your land, and my Prophethood will assume preponderance over your kingship."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Amr bin Al-’As, who was chosen to carry the letter, narrated the following story that happened before he was admitted into the audience of Jaifer.</p>
