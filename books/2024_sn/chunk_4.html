<p>In the year 619 CE, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) embarked on a crucial journey beyond Makkah, to a place called At-Ta’if, in an effort to spread the message of Islam. Accompanied by his companion Zaid bin Haritha, the Prophet encountered hostility from the people of At-Ta’if, particularly the influential chieftains of the Thaqeef tribe, who ridiculed and rejected his message. Despite his determination, the Prophet was met with abuse and stones were thrown at him by the local people, forcing him to leave the area in a painful and humiliating manner. However, during this challenging time, the Prophet found solace and strength in supplication to Allah, reaffirming his unwavering faith and trust in divine guidance.</p>
<p>Despite the adversity faced in At-Ta’if, the Prophet Muhammad's resolve to spread Islam remained steadfast. As he returned to Makkah, he experienced a significant spiritual encounter: the angel Gabriel, along with the angel of the mountains, offered to destroy the hostile city between its mountains as a form of retribution for their treatment of him. The Prophet, renowned for his mercy and hopefulness for humanity’s guidance, declined this offer, instead expressing hope that future generations from At-Ta’if would embrace Islam. This incident illustrated the Prophet's exemplary character and deep compassion, which later became a source of divine reassurance and support, indicating that his mission would ultimately triumph despite setbacks.</p>
<p>During this period of tribulation, the Prophet was encouraged by the first signs of broader acceptance and divine intervention when a group of jinns listened to him reciting the Qur'an and embraced Islam. This spiritual support was reinforced by more tangible help from individuals in Makkah, such as Mut'im bin 'Adi, who offered protection. These developments fostered renewed vigor and hope for the Prophet, who continued his mission with fresh determination. Despite initial hardships, his efforts bore fruit as individuals and tribes gradually warmed to his message, heralding a new chapter in the Islamic mission with the nascent support from the Yathrib (Madinah) region, laying the groundwork for future successes.</p>
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Swaid bin Samit</strong>: He was an intelligent, discreet poet from Yathrib (Madinah). During his stay in Makkah for pilgrimage (or lesser pilgrimage), he encountered the Prophet [pbuh] who invited him to embrace Islam. At this invitation, Swaid imparted to the Prophet some sound words from Luqman’s wisdom. The Prophet approved of that wisdom but told the man that he had something far better. He recited some verses from the Qur’ân, the man listened meditatively, and the words appealed to his originally pure nature and he accepted Islam as his faith at once. He was killed in the battle of Bu‘ath. That was in the eleventh year of the Prophethood. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eyas bin Mu‘adh</strong>: He was still a youth from the Aws tribe. He came as a member of a delegation seeking alliance with Quraish against another rival tribe dwelling in Madinah, Al-Khazraj. The Prophet [pbuh] met them and advised them to follow a better course than that they had in mind. He introduced himself and Islam to them, apprised them of his mission, and narrated some verses from the Noble Qur’ân. Eyas’s heart immediately absorbed the Divine Message and agreed with the Prophet [pbuh]. Abul Haisar Anas bin Rafi‘, a member of the delegation, disapproved of the boy’s behavior and silenced him by hurling some dust into his face. The people then left Madinah after having failed in establishing an alliance with Quraish. Shortly after arrival in Madinah, the boy breathed his last acclaiming Allâh’s Name and celebrating His Glory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari</strong>: He used to live in the suburbs of Yathrib. News of the Islamization of Swaid bin Samit and Eyas bin Mu‘adh reached him and constituted a turning point in his life per se. He sent his brother to Makkah for more details about the Prophet’s intentions. The man came back and reported to Abu Dhar that the ‘said man’ enjoined good and forbade evil. Abu Dhar was not satisfied and decided that he himself should go out and probe the real situation. After some attempts to identify the person of the Prophet [pbuh], he managed to meet him, though not without some difficulties due to the antagonistic atmosphere within which the proponents of the new faith were trying to work their way. No sooner than Abu Dhar was exposed to the real nature of Islam, he embraced it. Despite the Prophet’s earnest plea not to divulge his new move, Abu Dhar went directly to the Holy Sanctuary where he publicly declared that he had testified to the Oneness of Allâh and the Prophethood of Muhammad. The heathens all around hurried and began beating him. He almost died when Al-‘Abbas intervened warning against killing someone whose tribe was in full command of the strategic commercial caravan routes leading to Makkah. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tufail bin ‘Amr Ad-Dausi</strong>: He was an honest poet and chief of Ad-Daus tribe inhabiting an area close to Yemen in South Arabia. He arrived in Makkah in the eleventh year of Prophethood. Great reception ceremonies were accorded to him on his advent. The Makkans soon started to inculcate in his ears all sorts of antipathy against the Prophet [pbuh]. They even alleged that he had caused the most horrible societal schism, dividing all sorts of social life even the family ties were subject to his schemes and plans of dissension. They even warned him against speaking or even listening to him. The man, overpowered by these pleas, complied with their requests. He even stuffed his ears with a piece of cotton in order not to hear any word of his. However, when this tribesman entered the mosque, he saw Muhammad [pbuh] observing his prayer and out of curiosity, he approached him for it was a Divine Will to hear the Prophet’s sound and appealing words. The temptation to hear more was irresistible so he followed the Prophet [pbuh] into his house, briefed him on his advent and all the story of the people of Quraish. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] recited some verses of the Noble Qur’ân, and the man managed to taste something exceptionally beautiful and discern the truth latent within. He embraced Islam and testified that there was no god but Allâh and that Muhammad was His Messenger. He then said that he was an influential man among his people and that he would call them to profess Islam, yet he wanted the Prophet [pbuh] to equip him with a supportive sign that would ease his future task. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dhumad Al-Azdi</strong>: He came from Azd Shanu’a in Yemen, specialist in incantation. He arrived in Makkah to hear the fools there say that Muhammad [pbuh] was out of his mind. He decided to practice his craft on the Prophet [pbuh], who on seeing him said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Praise is to Allâh, we entertain His praise and seek His help. Whomsoever Allâh guides, none will lead astray, and whomsoever Allâh leads astray, none will guide. I testify there is no god but Allâh and Muhammad is His servant and Messenger." 
   Dhumad heard the words and requested the Prophet [pbuh] to echo them again, and he was granted his wish thrice. Here he said: "I have heard the soothsayers, sorcerers and poets, but never have I experienced the sweetness of your words." He then gave a pledge of a sincere convert.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Hope Inspiring Breezes from the Madinese</h1>
<p>During the pilgrimage season, in the eleventh year of Prophethood, the Islamic Call found the righteous seeds through which it would grow up to constitute tall trees whose leaves would foster the new faith and shelter the new vulnerable converts from the blows of injustices and high-handedness of Quraish. It was the Prophet’s wise practice to meet the delegates of the Arabian tribes by night so that the hostile Makkans would not debar him from achieving his objectives. </p>
<p>In the company of his two truthful Companions ‘Ali and Abu Bakr, he had an interesting talk regarding Islamization with Bani Dhuhal, but the latter suspended their conversion. In pursuit of the same objective, the Prophet and his Companions passed by ‘Aqabat Mina where they heard people talking. They went at their heels until they encountered six men from Yathrib, all of whom were from the Khazraj tribe: As‘ad bin Zurarah, ‘Awf bin Harith, Rafi‘ bin Malik, Qutbah bin ‘Amir, ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir, and Jabir bin ‘Abdullah. The last two being from Aws and the former four from Khazraj.</p>
<p>The Madinese always heard the Jews say that a Prophet was about to rise, for the time for a new dispensation had arrived. Him they would follow and then smite their enemies as the children of ‘Ad and Iram had been smitten. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Of what tribe are you?" asked the Prophet. 
"Of the tribe of Khazraj," they replied. 
"Are you the allies of the Jews?" The Prophet enquired. 
They said: "Yes." 
"Then why not sit down for a little and I will speak to you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The offer was readily accepted for the fame of Muhammad [pbuh] had spread to Madinah and the strangers were curious to see more of the man who had created a stir in the whole area. The Prophet [pbuh] presented to them an expose of Islam, explained its implications, and the responsibilities that fell upon the men who accepted it. </p>
<p>When the Prophet [pbuh] concluded his talk, they exchanged among themselves ideas to the following effect: "Know surely, this is the Prophet with whom the Jews are ever threatening us; wherefore let us make haste and be the first to join him." They, therefore, embraced Islam and said to the Prophet, "We have left our community for no tribe is so divided by hatred and rancour as they are. Allâh may cement our ties through you. So let us go and invite them to this religion of yours; and if Allâh unites them in it, no man will be dearer than you." The handful of Madinese converts remained steady to the cause, and they preached Islam with full zeal and devotion with the result that they succeeded in winning adherents for Islam from amongst their fellow citizens. Hardly was there a house in Madinah not talking curiously and enthusiastically about the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. </p>
<h1>Marriage of the Prophet [pbuh] to ‘Aishah [R]</h1>
<p>In Shawwal of the same year, the Prophet [pbuh] concluded a marriage contract with ‘Aishah [R], ‘the truth verifier’, when she was six years of age and consummated his marriage with her in Shawwal, the year 1 A.H. in Madinah when she was nine.</p>
<h1>Al-Isra’ and Al-Mi‘raj</h1>
<p>(The Miraculous Night Journey from Makkah to the Farthest Mosque in Jerusalem, and the Ascent through the Spheres of Heavens)</p>
<p>The last days of the Makkan phase of the Prophet’s life are noted for alternate fortunes ranging between two extremes: gradual success and continual persecution. However, glimpses of propitious lights were looming on the distant horizon, to ultimately materialize in the event of the Prophet’s Night Journey to Jerusalem and then Ascension through the spheres of the heavens.</p>
<p>As for its exact date, it is still controversial and no common consent has been reached. However, the majority of jurists is in favour of a date between 16-12 months prior to migration to Madinah. The following is an epitome of the details of that miraculous event narrated on the authority of Ibn Al-Qayyim.</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was carried in body from the Sacred Mosque in Makkah to the Distant Mosque in Jerusalem on a horse called Al-Buraq in the company of Gabriel, the archangel. There he alighted, tethered the horse to a ring in the gate of the Mosque and led the Prophets in prayer. After that Gabriel took him to the heavens on the same horse. </p>
<p>When they reached the first heaven, Gabriel asked the guardian angel to open the door of heaven. It was opened and he saw Adam, the progenitor of mankind. The Prophet [pbuh] saluted him, and the other welcomed him and expressed his faith in Muhammad’s Prophethood. He saw the souls of martyrs on his right and those of the wretched on his left. </p>
<p>Gabriel then ascended with the Prophet to the second heaven, asked for opening the gate and there he saw and saluted John, son of Zachariya (Yahya bin Zakariya) and Jesus, son of Mary. They returned the salutation, welcomed him, and expressed their faith in his Prophethood. Then they reached the third heaven where they saw Joseph (Yusuf) and saluted him. The latter welcomed the Prophet and expressed faith in his Prophethood. </p>
<p>The Prophet, in the company of Gabriel, then reached the fourth heaven where he met the Prophet Enoch (Idris) and saluted him. Prophet Enoch returned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. Then he was carried to the fifth heaven where he met the Prophet Aaron (Harun) and saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. </p>
<p>In the sixth heaven, he met Moses (Musa) and saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. Muhammad [pbuh], on leaving, saw that Moses began to weep. He asked about the reason. Moses answered that he was weeping because he witnessed a man sent after him as a Messenger (Muhammad) who was able to lead more of his people to Paradise than he himself did. </p>
<p>Then the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] reached the seventh heaven and met Abraham (Ibrahim) and saluted him. The latter returned the salutation and expressed faith in his Prophethood. Then he was carried to Sidrat-al-Muntaha (the remotest lote tree) and was shown Al-Bait-al-Ma‘mûr [(the much frequented house) which is like the Ka‘bah (Sacred House) encompassed daily by seventy thousand angels, so that the angels who once encompassed it would not have their turn again till the Resurrection]. He was then presented to the Divine Presence and experienced the thrill of witnessing the Divine Glory and Manifestation at the closest possible propinquity. </p>
<p>There the Lord revealed unto His servant that which He revealed, and ordained fifty daily prayers for him. On his return, he spoke to Moses that his followers had been enjoined to pray fifty times a day. Moses addressing the Prophet [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your followers cannot perform so many prayers. Go back to your Lord and ask for a remission in number." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] turned to Gabriel as if holding counsel with him. Gabriel nodded, "Yes, if you desire," and ascended with him to the Presence of Allâh. The All-Mighty Allâh, Glory is to Him, made a reduction of ten prayers. He then descended and reported that to Moses, who again urged him to request a further reduction. </p>
<p>Muhammad [pbuh] once more begged his Lord to reduce the number still further. He went again and again in the Presence of Allâh at the suggestion of Moses for reduction in the number of prayers until these were reduced to five only. Moses again asked him to implore for more reduction, but he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I feel ashamed now of repeatedly asking my Lord for reduction. I accept and resign to His Will." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Muhammad [pbuh] went farther, a Caller was heard saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have imposed My Ordinance and alleviated the burden of My servants." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is, however, some difference as regards the issue of whether the Prophet saw Allâh with his physical eye or not. Some interpreters say that seeing Allâh with his naked eyes was not confirmed. Ibn ‘Abbas, on the other hand, says that the word Ru’ya as used in the Noble Qur’ân signifies the observation with the help of the eye. In Sûrah An-Najm (Chapter —The Star) we read: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then he approached and came closer." [Al-Qur'an 53:8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here (he) refers to archangel Gabriel, and this context is completely different from that in the Prophetic tradition of Isra’ and Mi‘raj, where ‘the approach’ relates to that of the Lord, Glory is to Him.</p>
<p>Some significant suggestive incidents featured the ‘Night Journey’ of the Prophet, of which we could mention: 
1. The Prophet’s breast was cleft by Gabriel, his heart extracted and washed with the water of Zamzam —a sacred spring in Makkah.
2. In the same context, there were brought to him two gold vessels. There was milk in one, while the other was full of wine. He was asked to choose either of them, so he selected the vessel containing milk and drank it. He (the angel) said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You have been guided on Al-Fitrah or you have attained Al-Fitrah. Had you selected wine, your nation would have been misled." </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is a symbolic way of saying that good and evil in the form of milk and wine were brought before the Prophet and he instinctively made a choice for the good. It is very difficult to render the Arabic term ‘Fitrah’ into English. It denotes the original constitution or disposition, with which a child comes into this world, as contrasted with qualities or inclinations acquired during life; besides it refers to the spiritual inclination inherent in man in his unspoilt state.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>The Prophet [pbuh] told that he saw two manifest rivers, — the Nile and the Euphrates — and two hidden ones. It appears that the two manifest rivers, the Nile and the Euphrates, symbolically describe the area in whose fertile valleys, Muhammad’s Message will settle, and the people whereof will always remain the adherent bearers of Islam that will be passed on from generation to another. They can by no means suggest that they well up from the Garden. </li>
<li>
<p>He had the opportunity to see Malik, the guardian of Hell, with a cheerless frowning face. Therein, he saw the Hell dwellers, of whom were those who unjustly eat up the property of the orphans. They have flews similar to those of camels, swallowing red-hot stones and then issuing out of their backs. There were also the people who take usury with bellies too big to be able to move around; they are trodden by the people of Pharaoh when these are admitted into Hell. In the same abode, he saw the adulterers offered tasty fatty meat and rotten smelly one but they make option for the latter. The licentious women were also there hanging from their breasts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ‘Night Journey’ raised a good deal of stir among the people and the sceptical audience plied Muhammad with all sorts of questions. He told them that he saw the camels of Makkan merchants to and fro. He also guided them to some of their animals that went astray. He informed them that he had drunk some of their water while they were fast asleep and left the container covered. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The disbelievers, however, found it a suitable opportunity to jeer at the Muslims and their creed. They pestered the Prophet [pbuh] with questions as to the description of the Mosque at Jerusalem, where he had never gone before and, to the astonishment of many, the Prophet’s replies furnished the most accurate information about that city. He supplied them with all the news about their caravans and the routes of their camels. However, all this increased in them nothing but flight from the Truth, and they accepted nothing but disbelief. </p>
<p>For the true Muslims, however, there was nothing unusual about the Night Journey. The All-Mighty Allâh, Who is Powerful enough to have created the heavens and the earth by an act of His Will, is surely Powerful enough to take His Messenger beyond the heavens and show him those signs of His at firsthand which are inaccessible to man otherwise. The disbelievers on their part went to see Abu Bakr on account of this event, and he readily said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, I do verify it." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was on this occasion that he earned the title of As-Siddiq (the verifier of the truth). </p>
<p>The most eloquent and most concise justification of this ‘Journey’ is expressed in Allâh’s Words: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... in order that We might show him (Muhammad) of Our Ayât (proofs, evidences, signs, etc.)" [Al-Qur'an 17:1]. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Divine rules as regards the Prophets goes as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he be one of those who have Faith with certainty." [Al-Qur'an 6:75]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To Moses, his Lord said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That We may show you (some) of Our Greater Signs." [Al-Qur'an 20:23] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He be of those who have Faith with certainty." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophets, after seeing Allâh’s Signs, will establish their Faith on solid certainty too immune to be parted with. They are in fact eligible for this Divine privilege because they are the ones who will bear burdens too heavy for other ordinary people to carry, and in the process of their mission, they will regard all worldly ordeals and agonies too small to care about. </p>
<p>There are simple facts that emanate from this blessed Journey, and flow along into the flowery garden of the Prophetic biography; peace and blessings of Allâh be upon its author, Muhammad. The story of ‘the Night Journey’ as we see in the Noble Qur’ân is epitomized in the first verse of the Sûrah Isra’(Chapter 17 — The Journey by Night), then there is a quick shift to uncover the shameful deeds and crimes of the Jews, followed by an admonition saying that the Qur’ân guides to that which is most just and right. </p>
<p>This arrangement is not in fact a mere coincidence. Jerusalem was the first scene of the Night Journey, and here lies the message directed to the Jews, which explicitly suggested that they would be discharged of the office of leadership of mankind due to the crimes they had perpetrated, which no longer justified their occupation of that office. The message suggested explicitly that the office of leadership would be reinstituted by the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to hold in his hand both headquarters of the Abrahamic Faith, the Holy Sanctuary in Makkah and the Farthest Mosque in Jerusalem. </p>
<p>It was high time for the spiritual authority to be transferred from a nation whose history got pregnant with treachery, covenant-breaching and aggression to another nation blessed with piety and dutifulness to Allâh, with a Messenger who enjoys the privilege of the Qur’ânic Revelation, which leads to that which is best and right. </p>
<p>There, however, remains a crucial question waiting to be answered: How could this foreseen transition of authority be effected while the champion himself (Muhammad) was left deserted and forsaken stumbling in the hillocks of Makkah? This question per se uncovered the secrets of another issue which referred to a phase of the Islamic Call and the appearance of another role it was about to take up, different in its course and noble in its approaches. </p>
<p>The forerunners of that new task took the shape of Qur’ânic verses smacking of direct and unequivocal warning accompanied by a severe ultimatum directed to the polytheists and their agents: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And when We decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a definite order (to obey Allâh and be righteous) to those among them [or We (first) increase in number those of its population] who are given the good things of this life. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of torment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete destruction. And how many generations (past nations) have We destroyed after Noah! And Sufficient is your Lord as an All-Knower and All-Beholder of the sins of His slaves." [Al-Qur'an 17:16, 17] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together with these verses, there were others revealed to show the Muslims the rules and items of the civilization upon which they could erect their Muslim community, and foreshadowing their ownership of a piece of land, exercising full freedom over it and establishing a coherent society around whose axis the whole humanity would rotate. Those verses in reality implied better prospects for the Prophet [pbuh] comprising a secure shelter to settle in, and headquarters safe enough to empower and embolden him to communicate his Message to all the world at large; that was in fact the inner secret of that blessed journey. For this very wisdom and the like we deem it appropriate to suggest that ‘the Night Journey’ took place either before the First Pledge of ‘Aqabah or between the two; after all, Allâh knows best.</p>
<h1>The First ‘Aqabah Pledge</h1>
<p>We have already spoken about six Madinese who embraced Islam in the pilgrimage season in the eleventh year of Prophethood. They promised to communicate the Message of Islam to their townsfolk.</p>
<p>The following year, on the occasion of the pilgrimage, there came a group of twelve disciples ready to acknowledge Muhammad as their Prophet. The group of men comprised five of the six who had met the Prophet [pbuh] the year before. The sixth who stayed away was Jabir bin ‘Abdullah bin Reyab, the other seven were: 
1. Mu‘adh bin Al-Harith, Ibn ‘Afra, from Khazraj.<br />
2. Dhakwan bin ‘Abd Al-Qais, from Khazraj.<br />
3. ‘Ubadah bin As-Samit, from Khazraj.<br />
4. Yazeed bin Tha‘labah, from Khazraj.<br />
5. ‘Al-‘Abbas bin ‘Ubadah bin Nadalah, from Khazraj.<br />
6. Abul Haitham bin At-Taihan, from Aws.<br />
7. ‘Uwaim bin Sa‘idah, from Aws.  </p>
<p>They avowed their faith in Muhammad [pbuh] as a Prophet and swore: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We will not worship anyone but one Allah; we will not steal; neither will we commit adultery, nor kill our children; we will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood and we will not disobey you in any just matter." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When they had taken the pledge, Muhammad [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He who carries it out, Allâh will reward him; and who neglects anything and is afflicted in this world, it may prove redemption for him in the Hereafter; and if the sin remains hidden from the eyes of men and no grief comes to him, then his affair is with Allâh. He may forgive him or He may not." </p>
</blockquote>
<h1>The Muslim Envoy in Madinah</h1>
<p>After the Pledge (in the form of an oath had been taken), the Prophet [pbuh] sent to Yathrib (Madinah) Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair Al-‘Abdari [R], the first Muslim ‘ambassador’ to teach the people there the doctrines of Islam, give them practical guidance, and make attempts at propagating Islam among those who still professed polytheism. As‘ad bin Zurarah hosted him in Madinah. So prepared was the ground, and so zealous the propagation that Islam spread rapidly from house to house and from tribe to tribe. </p>
<p>There were various cheerful and promising aspects of success that characterized Mus‘ab’s task. One day Mus‘ab and As‘ad were on their way to the habitations of Bani ‘Abd Al-Ashhal and Bani Zafar, when they went into the premises of the latter clan. There they sat near a well conversing with some new converts. Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh and Usaid bin Hudair, chiefs of the two clans, heard of this meeting, so Usaid approached the Muslims armed with his lance while the other Sa‘d excused himself on grounds that As‘ad was his maternal cousin. Usaid came closer cursing and swearing and accused the two men of befooling people weak of heart and ordered that they stop it altogether. </p>
<p>Mus‘ab calmly invited him to sit saying, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you are pleased with our talk, you can accept it; should you hold it in abhorrence, you could freely immunize yourself against what you hate." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"That’s fair," said Usaid, pierced his lance in the sand, listened to Mus‘ab and then heard some verses of the Noble Qur’ân. His face bespoke satisfaction and pleasure before uttering any words of approval. He asked the two men about the procedures pertinent to embracing Islam. They asked him to observe washing, purge his garment, bear witness to the Truth and then perform two Rak‘a. He responded and did exactly what he was asked to do, and then said there was a man (Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh) whose people would never hang back if he followed the Islam. He then left to see Sa‘d and his people. </p>
<p>Sa‘d could immediately understand that Usaid had changed. To a question posed by Sa‘d, Usaid said that two men were ready to comply with whatever orders they received. He then managed a certain situation that provided the two men with a chance to talk with Sa‘d privately. The previous scene with Usaid recurred and Sa‘d embraced Islam, and directly turned to his people swearing that he would never talk with them until they had believed in Allâh, and in His Messenger. </p>
<p>Hardly did the evening of that day arrive when all the men and women of that sept of Arabians embraced Islam with the exception of one, Al-Usairim, who hung back until the Day of Uhud. On that day he embraced Islam and fought the polytheists but was eventually killed before observing any prostration in the way of prayer. The Prophet [pbuh] commented saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He has done a little but his reward is great." 
Mus‘ab stayed in Madinah carrying out his mission diligently and successfully until all the houses of Al-Ansar (the future Helpers) had Muslims. One family only stood obdurate to the Islamic Da‘wah (Call). They were under the influence of the poet Qais bin Al-Aslat, who managed to hold them at bay and screen off the Call of Islam from their ears until the year 5 A.H. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly before the approach of the following pilgrimage season, i.e. the thirteenth year of Prophethood, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair returned to Makkah carrying to the Prophet [pbuh] glad tidings about the new fertile soil of Islam in Madinah and its environment rich in the prospects of good, and the power and immunity that that city was bound to provide to the cause of Islam.</p>
<h1>The Second ‘Aqabah Pledge</h1>
<p>The next year, thirteenth of Prophethood, June 622 A.D., during the pilgrimage season, over seventy converts from Madinah came in the trail of their polytheist people to perform the rituals of pilgrimage in Makkah. The oft-repeated question among them was, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Isn’t it high time we protect Muhammad instead of leaving him forsaken, deserted and stumbling in the hillocks of Makkah?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly after arrival, they conducted clandestine contacts with the Prophet [pbuh] and agreed to meet him secretly at night in mid Tashreeq Days (the 11th, 12th, and 13th days of Dhul Hijja) in a hillock at Al-‘Aqabah, the last year’s meeting place. One of the leaders of the Ansâr (Helpers), Ka‘b bin Malik Al-Ansari, gave an account of the historic meeting which changed the whole course of the struggle between Islam and paganism, he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We set out for pilgrimage and struck a rendezvous in mid Tashreeq Days. We were accompanied by a celebrity and a notable of ours called ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin Haram, who was still a polytheist. We disclosed to him our intention of meeting Muhammad [pbuh] and exhorted him to join our ranks and give up polytheism lest he should serve as wood for Hell in the Hereafter. He promptly embraced Islam and witnessed the serious meeting at Al-‘Aqabah." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That very night we slept with our people in our camps. After a third of the night had elapsed, we began to leave stealthily and met in a hillock nearby. We were seventy-three men and two women, Nusaibah bint Ka‘b from the Najjars and Asma’ bint ‘Amr from Bani Salamah. We waited for the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] until he came in the company of his uncle Al-‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib who (though himself not a Muslim), adjured us not to draw his nephew away from the protection of his own kindred unless we were fully prepared to defend him even at the risk of our lives. He was the first to speak: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O you people of the Khazraj — the Arabs used to call the Ansâr (Helpers) Khazraj, whether from Khazraj or Aws — you all know the position that Muhammad holds among us. We have protected him from our people as much as we could. He is honoured and respected among his people. He refuses to join any party except you. </p>
<p>So if you think you can carry out what you promise while inviting him to your town, and if you can defend him against the enemies, then assume the burden that you have taken. But if you are going to surrender him and betray him after having taken him away with you, you had better leave him now because he is respected and well defended in his own place." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ka‘b replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have heard your words, and now O Messenger of Allâh, it is for you to speak and take from us any pledge that you want regarding your Lord and your self." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a definite stance showing full determination, courage and deep faith to shoulder the daunting responsibility and bear its serious consequences. </p>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh then preached the Faith, and the pledge was taken. Al-Imam Ahmad, on the authority of Jabir, gave the following details: </p>
<p>The Ansâr (Helpers) asked the Messenger of Allâh about the principles over which they would take a pledge. The Prophet answered: </p>
<ol>
<li>To listen and obey in all sets of circumstances.  </li>
<li>To spend in plenty as well as in scarcity.  </li>
<li>To enjoin good and forbid evil.  </li>
<li>In Allâh’s service, you will fear the censure of none.  </li>
<li>To defend me in case I seek your help, and debar me from anything you debar yourself, your spouses and children from. And if you observe those precepts, Paradise is in store for you.</li>
</ol>
<p>In another version narrated by Ka‘b, he said: </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] began to speak, recited some Qur’ânic verses, called people unto Allâh, exhorted them to enter the fold of Islam and concluded saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I give you my pledge that you debar me from whatever you debar your women and children from." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Al-Bara’ bin Ma‘rur caught him by hand and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh yes, we swear by Allâh, Who sent you as a Prophet in Truth, that we will debar you from whatever we debar our women from. Have confidence in us, O Messenger of Allâh. By Allâh, we are genuine fighters and quite reliable in war; it is a trait passed down to us from our ancestors." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then ‘Abul Haitham At-Taihan interrupted and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Prophet of Allâh! Between us and the Jews, there are agreements which we would then sever. If Allâh grants you power and victory, should we expect that you would not leave us, and join the ranks of your people (meaning Quraish)?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] smiled and replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nay, it would never be; your blood will be my blood. In life and death I will be with you and you with me. I will fight whom you fight and I will make peace with those with whom you make peace." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the negotiations concerning the conditions of allegiance had ended, and all of the audience were unanimously agreed to ratify it, two men of the early generation of converts who had embraced Islam in the eleventh and twelfth years rose to their feet to apprise the others of the serious step they were about to take so that they could give their pledge fully aware of the whole affair and consequently be ready for the sacrifice they were expected to make. Al ‘Abbas bin Ubada bin Nadlah, in this context, remarked: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O you people of Khazraj! Do you know the significance of the pact that you are entering into with this man? You are in fact avowing that you will fight against all and sundry. If you fear that your property will be at stake or the lives of your nobles will be endangered, then leave him now, because if you do this after the pledge, it will be degrading for you both in this world and the world to come. But if you think that you can carry out what you are called upon to do in spite of the loss of precious lives and property, then undertake this heavy responsibility, and I swear by Allâh, that herein lies the good of this world and that of the next." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They replied, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have already considered the loss of property and the murder of our notables, yet we pay him allegiance. But what is our reward if we observe all the items of this pact?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Paradise is in store for you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then they asked him to stretch out his hand, and they all stretched out their hands and took the pledge. Only at that time did As‘ad bin Zurarah come to realize the people’s readiness for sacrifice in the cause of Allâh.</p>
<p>On the authority of Jabir, who said: "When we started to pay allegiance to the Prophet [pbuh], As‘ad bin Zurarah stood up and gave the following short address: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Take it easy, people of Yathrib! We have not covered that long distance except because we have had deep belief that he (Muhammad [pbuh]) is the Messenger of Allâh. We are already convinced that following him entails departure from the pagan Arabs even if it were at the risk of our life. Should you preserve in this course, hold fast to it, and your great reward is placed in the Hand of Allâh, but if you are caught in fear, I admonish you to give it up just now, and then you would be more excusable by Allâh." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to the two women, the pledge was taken orally for the Prophet [pbuh] had never shaken hands with a strange lady.</p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] then asked the group to appoint twelve deputies to preach Islam to their people in Madinah, to shoulder the responsibility of implementing the articles of this pledge and to guide the respective men of their own tribes in matters relating to the propagation of Islam. The deputies elected were nine from Al-Khazraj: As‘ad bin Zurarah bin ‘Ads, Sa‘d bin Ar-Rabi‘ bin ‘Amr, ‘Abdullah bin Rawahah bin Tha‘labah, Rafi‘ bin Malik bin Al-‘Ajlan, Al-Bara’ bin Ma‘rur bin Sakhr, ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin Haram, ‘Ubadah bin As-Samit bin Qais, Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah bin Dulaim, and Al-Mundhir bin ‘Amr bin Khunais. Three others were from Al-Aws: Usaid bin Hudair bin Sammak, Sa‘d bin Khaithamah bin Al-Harith, and Rifa‘a bin ‘Abdul Mundhir bin Zubair. </p>
<p>Once again, those twelve men were sworn to act as surety over the affairs of their people just as the Christ’s disciples did, and the Prophet would act as surety over his people, meaning all the Muslims. </p>
<p>Somehow or other, the news of these secret desert meetings with the Madinese leaked out. The Prophet immediately knew that it was a certain pudgy ugly devil, inhabited in Al-‘Aqabah, who discovered their meeting, and he threatened to settle his account with him as soon as possible. </p>
<p>On hearing this, Al-‘Abbas bin Nadlah said </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By Allâh, Who has sent you in Truth, we are powerful enough to put the people of Mina (the Quraishites) to our swords tomorrow, if you desire." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] said </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have not been commanded to follow that course. Now, back to your camps." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They went back to sleep till morning. </p>
<p>No sooner did Quraish hear of this treaty than a kind of trouble-provoking tumult began to mushroom in all directions. They realized quite fully that an allegiance of this sort is bound to produce far-reaching ramifications of direct impact on their lives and wealth. The following day, a large delegation comprising the leaders and arch-criminals of Makkah set out for the camp of the Madinese to protest severely against the treaty. They addressed the Madinese: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O people of Khazraj, it transpired to us that you have come here to conclude a treaty with this man (Muhammad) and evacuate him out of Makkah. By Allâh, we do really hold in abhorrence any sort of fight between you and us." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Madinese polytheists, having known nothing about the secretly taken pledge, began to swear by Allâh and answered in good faith that there was no truth in the report. ‘Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, a Madinese polytheist, refuted their allegations, denouncing them as null and void, claiming that his people would never initiate anything unless he gave them clear orders. </p>
<p>The Madinese Muslims, however, remained silent neither negating nor confirming. The Quraishite leaders seemed to be almost convinced by the arguments presented by the polytheists, and went back home frustrated. However, they did not fully acquiesce in the words they heard. They began to scrutinize the smallest details and trace the minutest news until it was established beyond a shadow of doubt that the pact did take place, but that was after the Madinese pilgrims had left Makkah. </p>
<p>In a fit of rage, they pursued the pilgrims but did not succeed in catching hold of anyone except Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah. They subjected him to unspeakable tortures, but he was later rescued by Al-Mut‘im bin ‘Adi and Harith bin Harb bin Omaiya with whom he had trade relations. </p>
<p>That is the story of the Second ‘Aqabah Pledge, later known as the Great ‘Aqabah Pledge, effected in an atmosphere of love, allegiance, and mutual support between Madinese believers and weak Makkan Muslims. This new spirit of affection, rapport, and cooperation could never be attributable to a fleeing whim; on the contrary, it totally derived from an already deeply-established approach, viz. Belief in Allâh, His Messenger, and His Book. It was a Belief so rooted in the selves that it managed to stand immune to all powers of injustice and aggression, and could be translated into miracles in the practical aspects of action and ideology pursuit. That sort of Belief was the real instrument for the Muslims to record in the annals of history unprecedented breakthroughs. We are also sure that the future will always remain wanting as regards those great achievements carried out by those great men. </p>
<h1>The Vanguard of Migration (in the Cause of Allâh)</h1>
<p>After the endorsement of the Second ‘Aqabah Pledge and the establishment of a petite Muslim state in a vast desert surging with disbelief and ignorance — the most serious gain in terms of Islam —, the Prophet [pbuh] gave his leave for the Muslims to migrate to Madinah, the nascent Muslim state.</p>
<p>Migration to Madinah, in terms of personal interests, was no more than material waste and sacrifice of wealth, all in return for personal safety only. Even here, the migrant could not expect full security; he was liable to be robbed or even killed either at the beginning or end of his departure. The future was foggy, pregnant with various unpredictable sorts of sorrows and crises.</p>
<p>Bearing all this in mind, the Muslims began to migrate, while the polytheists spared no effort in hindering and debarring them, knowing beforehand that such a move implied unimaginable threats and unthinkable destructive dangers to their whole society: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first one to migrate was Abu Salamah, a year before the Great ‘Aqabah Pledge. When he had made up his mind to leave Makkah, his in-laws, in a desperate attempt to raise obstacles, detained his wife and snatched his son and dislocated his hand. Umm Salamah, after the departure of her husband and the loss of her son, spent a year by herself weeping and lamenting. A relative of hers eventually had pity on her and exhorted the others to release her son and let her join her husband. She then set out on a journey of 500 kilometers with no help whatsoever. At a spot called At-Tan‘im, ‘Uthman bin Talhah came across her and offered to give her a ride to Madinah. She, along with her son, joined Abu Salamah in the village of Quba’, a suburb of Madinah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another instance of the atrocities of the polytheist Makkans regarding migration is Suhaib. This man expressed his wish to migrate and, of course, this was a source of indignation to the disbelievers. They began to insult him, claiming that he had come into Makkah as a worthless tramp, but their town was gracious enough, and thanks to them, he managed to make a lot of money and become wealthy. They gave orders that he would not leave. Seeing this, he offered to give away all his wealth to them. They eventually agreed to release him on that condition. The Prophet heard this story and commented on it saying:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Suhaib is the winner, after all."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, there was the story of ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, ‘Ayyash bin Abi Rabi‘a, and Hisham bin Al-‘Asi, who agreed to meet at a certain place one morning in order to leave for Madinah; ‘Umar and ‘Ayyash came but Hisham was detained by the Makkans. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Shortly afterwards Abu Jahl, and his brother Al-Harith came to Madinah to see their third brother ‘Ayyash. They cunningly tried to touch the most sensitive area in a man, i.e. his relation with his mother. They addressed him claiming that his mother had sworn she would never comb her hair, nor shade herself off the sun unless she had seen him. ‘Ayyash took pity on his mother, but ‘Umar was intelligent enough to understand that they wanted to entice ‘Ayyash away from Islam, so he cautioned him against their tricks and added: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your mother would comb her hair if lice pestered her, and would shade herself off if the sun of Makkah got too hot for her." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words notwithstanding, ‘Ayyash was determined to go and see his mother, so ‘Umar gave him his manageable docile camel, advising him to stick to its back because it would provide rescue for him if he perceived anything suspicious on their part. The party of three then set forth towards Makkah. As soon as they covered part of the distance, Abu Jahl complained about his camel and requested ‘Ayyash to allow him to ride behind him on his camel. When they knelt down to the level of the ground, the two polytheists fell upon ‘Ayyash and tied him. They rode on into Makkah, shouting at people to follow their example with respect to ‘fools’. </p>
<p>These are just three self-explanatory models of the Makkans’ reaction towards anyone intending to migrate. Nevertheless, the believers still managed to escape in successive groups and so rapidly that within two months of the Second ‘Aqabah Pledge, entire quarters of Makkah were deserted. Almost all the followers of Muhammad had migrated to their new abode, except Abu Bakr, ‘Ali, the Prophet [pbuh] himself, and those helpless noble souls who had been detained in confinement or were unable to escape. The Prophet [pbuh], together with Abu Bakr and ‘Ali, had made all the necessary preparations for migration but was waiting for leave from his Lord. </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that most of the Muslims who had migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) came back to Madinah to join the rest of the Muslims there. The situation was no doubt critical in Makkah but Muhammad [pbuh] was not at all perturbed. Abu Bakr was, however, urging the Prophet to depart from that town. He was also eagerly waiting for an opportunity to accompany Muhammad [pbuh] on this eventful journey. But the Prophet told him that the time had not yet come; the Lord had not given him the command to migrate. </p>
<p>In anticipation of the Command of Allâh, Abu Bakr had made preparations for the journey. He had purchased two swift camels and had fed them properly for four months so that they could successively stand the ordeals of the long desert journey.</p>
<h1>In An-Nadwah (Council) House</h1>
<h2>The Parliament of Quraish</h2>
<p>On the 26th of Safar, the year fourteen of Prophethood / 12th September 622 A.D, the polytheists were paralyzed by the carefully planned and speedy movement of Muhammad’s followers towards their new abode in Madinah. They were caught in unprecedented anxiety and got deeply worried over their whole pagan and economic entity. They already experienced Muhammad [pbuh] as an influential leader; and his followers as determined, decent, and always ready to sacrifice all they had for the sake of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj tribes, the would-be-hosts of the Makkan Muslims, were also known in Arabia for their might and power in war, and judicious and sensible approach in peace. They were also averse to rancour and prejudice for they themselves had had bitter days of inter-tribal warfare. </p>
<p>Madinah, itself, the prospective headquarters of the ever-growing Islamic Call, enjoyed the most serious strategic position. It commanded the commercial routes leading to Makkah whose people used to deal in about a quarter of a million gold dinar-worth commodities every year. Security of the caravan routes was crucial for the perpetuity of prosperous economic life. </p>
<p>All those factors borne in mind, the polytheists felt they were in the grip of a serious threat. They, therefore, began to seek the most effective method that could avert this imminent danger. They convened a meeting on Thursday, 26th Safar, and on that day, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the Parliament of Makkah" held the most serious meeting ever, with one item on the agenda: How to take effective measures to stop that tidal wave. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delegates representing all the Quraishite tribes attended the meeting, the most significant of whom were: 
1. Abu Jahl bin Hisham, from Bani Makhzum;<br />
2. Jubair bin Mut‘im, Tuaima bin ‘Adi, and Al-Harith bin ‘Amir representing Bani Naufal bin ‘Abd Munaf;<br />
3. Rabi‘a’s two sons Shaibah and ‘Utbah besides Abu Sufyan bin Harb from Bani ‘Abd Shams bin ‘Abd Munaf;<br />
4. An-Nadr bin Al-Harith (who had besmeared the Prophet [pbuh] with animal entrails) to speak for Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar;<br />
5. Abul Bukhtary bin Hisham, Zama‘a bin Al-Aswad, and Hakeem bin Hizam to represent Bani Asad bin ‘Abd Al-‘Uzza;<br />
6. Al-Hajjaj’s two sons Nabih and Munbih from Bani Sahm;<br />
7. Omaiyah bin Khalaf from Bani Jumah. </p>
<p>On their way to An-Nadwah House, Iblis (Satan), in the guise of a venerable elderly man standing at the door interrupted their talk and introduced himself as a man from Najd curious enough to attend the meeting, listen to the debate, and wish them success in reaching a sound opinion. He was readily admitted. </p>
<p>There was a lengthy debate and several proposals were put forward. Expulsion from Makkah was proposed and debated in turn but finally turned down on the grounds that his sweet and heart-touching words could entice the other Arabs to attack them in their own city. Imprisonment for life was also debated but also refused for fear that his followers might increase in number, overpower them, and release him by force. At this point, the arch-criminal of Makkah, Abu Jahl bin Hisham suggested that they assassinate him. However, assassination by one man would have exposed him and his family to the vengeance of blood. The difficulty was at last solved by Abu Jahl himself, who suggested that a band of young men, one from each tribe, should strike Muhammad simultaneously with their swords. </p>
<p>Thus, the blood-money would be spread over them all and therefore could not be exacted, and his people would seek a mind-based recourse for settlement. The sinful proposal was unanimously accepted, and the representatives broke up the meeting and went back home with full determination for immediate implementation. </p>
<h1>Migration of the Prophet [pbuh]</h1>
<p>When the iniquitous decision had been made, Gabriel was sent down to Muhammad [pbuh] to reveal to him Quraish’s plot and give him his Lord’s Permission to leave Makkah. He fixed to him the time of migration and asked him not to sleep that night in his usual bed. At noon, the Prophet [pbuh] went to see his Companion Abu Bakr and arranged with him everything for the intended migration. Abu Bakr was surprised to see the Prophet [pbuh] masked coming to visit him at that unusual time, but he soon learned that Allâh’s Command had arrived, and he proposed that they should migrate together, to which the Prophet [pbuh] gave his consent. </p>
<p>To make the necessary preparations for the implementation of their devilish plan, the chiefs of Makkah had chosen eleven men: Abu Jahl, Hakam bin Abil Al-‘As, ‘Uqbah bin Abi Mu‘ait, An-Nadr bin Harith, Omaiyah bin Khalaf, Zama‘a bin Al-Aswad, Tu‘aima bin ‘Adi, Abu Lahab, Ubai bin Khalaf, Nabih bin Al-Hajjaj, and his brother Munbih bin Al-Hajjaj. </p>
<p>All were on the alert. As night advanced, they posted assassins around the Prophet’s house. Thus they kept vigil all night long, waiting to kill him the moment he left his house early in the morning, peeping now and then through a hole in the door to make sure that he was still lying in his bed. </p>
<p>Abu Jahl, the great enemy of Islam, used to walk about haughtily and arrogantly jeering at Muhammad’s words, saying to the people around him: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Muhammad claims that if you follow him, he will appoint you rulers over the Arabs and non-Arabs and in the Hereafter your reward will be Gardens similar to those in Jordan, otherwise, he will slaughter you and after death, you will be burnt in fire." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was too confident of the success of his devilish plan. </p>
<p>Allâh, the All-Mighty, however, in Whose Hands lie the sovereignty of the heavens and earth, does what He desires; He renders succour and can never be overpowered. He did exactly what He later said to His Prophet: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) to imprison you, or to kill you, or to get you out (from your home, i.e. Makkah); they were plotting and Allâh too was planning, and Allâh is the Best of the planners." [Al-Qur'an 8:30] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that critical time, the plans of Quraish utterly failed despite the tight siege they laid to the Prophet’s house. The Prophet [pbuh] and ‘Ali were inside the house. The Prophet [pbuh] told ‘Ali to sleep in his bed and cover himself with his green mantle and assured him full security under Allâh’s protection and told him that no harm would come to him. </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] then came out of the room, cast a handful of dust at the assassins, and managed to work his way through them reciting verses of the Noble Qur’ân: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And We have put a barrier before them, and a barrier behind them, and We have covered them up, so that they cannot see." [Al-Qur'an 36:9] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He proceeded directly to the house of Abu Bakr, who immediately accompanied him and both set out southwards, clambered up the lofty peak of Mountain Thawr, and decided to take refuge in a cave. </p>
<p>The assassins who laid siege to the house were waiting for the zero hour when someone came and informed them that the Prophet [pbuh] had already left. They rushed in and to their utter surprise, found that the person lying in the Prophet’s bed was ‘Ali, not Muhammad [pbuh]. This created a stir in the whole town. The Prophet [pbuh] had thus left his house on Safar 27th, the fourteenth year of Prophethood, i.e. 12/13 September 622 A.D. </p>
<p>Knowing already that Quraish would mobilize all its potentials to find him, he played a clever trick on them and instead of taking the road to Madinah in the north side of Makkah, as the polytheists would expect, he walked along a road least expected lying south of Makkah leading to Yemen. He walked for 5 miles until he reached a rough rocky mountain called Thawr. </p>
<p>There his shoes were worn out; some said he used to walk tiptoe in order not to leave a trail behind him. Abu Bakr [R] carried him up the mountain to a cave called after the name of the mountain, Cave Thawr. Abu Bakr first entered to explore the cave and be sure that it was safe, closed all holes with pieces torn off from his clothes, cleaned it, and then asked the Prophet [pbuh] to step in. The Prophet [pbuh] went in and immediately laid his head in Abu Bakr’s lap and fell asleep. </p>
<p>Suddenly, Abu Bakr’s foot was stung by a poisonous insect. It hurt so much that his tears fell on the Prophet’s face. The Prophet [pbuh] immediately applied his saliva on Abu Bakr’s foot and the pain went off on the spot. They confined themselves to this cave for three nights, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. </p>
<p>‘Abdullah, the son of Abu Bakr would go to see them after dusk, stay the night there, apprise them of the latest situation in Makkah, and then leave in the early morning to mix with the Makkans as usual and not to draw the least attention to his clandestine activities. ‘Amir bin Fuhairah, while in the company of other shepherds of Makkah tending to his master Abu Bakr’s flock, used to steal away unobserved every evening with a few goats to the cave and furnished its inmates with a plentiful supply of milk.</p>
<p>Quraish, on the other hand, were quite baffled and exasperated when the news of the escape of the two companions was confirmed. They brought ‘Ali to Al-Ka‘bah, beat him brutally, and confined him there for an hour attempting desperately to make him divulge the secret of the disappearance of the two ‘fugitives’, but to no avail. They then went to see Asma’, Abu Bakr’s daughter, but here also their attempts went in vain. While at her door, Abu Jahl slapped the girl so severely that her earring broke up. </p>
<p>The notables of Makkah convened an emergency session to determine the future course of action and explore all areas that could help arrest the two men. They decided to block all avenues leading out of Makkah and imposed heavy armed surveillance over all potential exits. A price of 100 camels was set upon the head of each one. Horsemen, infantry, and tracers of tracks scoured the country. Once they even reached the mouth of the cave where the Prophet [pbuh] and Abu Bakr were hiding. </p>
<p>When he saw the enemy at a very close distance, Abu Bakr whispered to the Prophet [pbuh]: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What, if they were to look through the crevice and detect us?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] in his God-inspired calm replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Silence Abu Bakr! What do you think of those two with whom the Third is Allâh." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was really a Divine miracle; the chasers were only a few steps from the cave. For three days, Muhammad [pbuh] and Abu Bakr lived in the cave and Quraish continued their frantic efforts to get hold of them. </p>
<p>Someone called ‘Abdullah bin Uraiquit, who had not yet embraced Islam but was trusted by Abu Bakr, and had been hired by him as a guide, reached the cave after three nights according to a plan bringing with him Abu Bakr’s two camels. His report satisfied the noble ‘fugitives’ that the search had slackened. The opportunity to depart was come. </p>
<p>Here Abu Bakr offered the Prophet [pbuh] the swift animal to ride on. The latter agreed provided that he would pay its price. They took with them the food provisions that Asma’, daughter of Abu Bakr, brought and tied in a bundle with her waistband, after tearing it into two parts, hence the appellation attached to her: "Asma’ of the two waistbands." </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh], Abu Bakr, and ‘Amir bin Fuhairah departed, and their guide ‘Abdullah bin Uraiquit led them on hardly ever-trodden ways along the coastal route. That was in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, 1st year A.H., i.e. September 622 A.D. </p>
<p>The little caravan traveled through many villages on their way to Quba’. In this context, it is relevant to introduce some interesting incidents that featured their wearying journey: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One day they could find no shelter from the scorching heat, so Abu Bakr [R] cast a glance and found a little shade beside a rock. He cleaned the ground, spread his mantle for the Prophet [pbuh] to lie on, and himself went off in search of food. He came across a shepherd, a bedouin boy, who was also seeking shelter. Abu Bakr asked him for some milk and took it to the Prophet [pbuh], cooled it with some water, and waited until the Prophet [pbuh] woke up and quenched his thirst.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whoever asked Abu Bakr [R] about the identity of his honorable companion, he would reply that he was a man who guided him on his way. The questioner would think that Muhammad [pbuh] was a guide in terms of roads, whereas Abu Bakr used to mean guide to the way of righteousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quraish, as we have already mentioned, had declared that whoever would seize Muhammad [pbuh] would receive a hundred camels as a reward. This had spurred many persons to try their luck. Among those who were on the lookout for the Prophet [pbuh] and his companion in order to win the reward was Suraqah, the son of Malik. He, on receiving information that a party of four had been spotted on a certain route, decided to pursue it secretly so that he alone should be the winner of the reward. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>He mounted a swift horse and went in hot pursuit of them. On the way, the horse stumbled and he fell on the ground. On drawing a lot to divine whether he should continue the chase or not, as the Arabs used to do in such circumstances, he found the omens unpropitious. But the lust for material wealth blinded him altogether, and he resumed the chase. </p>
<p>Once more he met with the same fate but paid no heed to it. Again, he jumped onto the saddle and galloped at break-neck speed till he came quite close to the Prophet [pbuh]. Abu Bakr’s heart agitated and he kept looking back while the Prophet [pbuh] remained steadfast and continued reciting verses of the Qur’ân. </p>
<p>The repeated stumbling of Suraqah’s horse and his falling off awakened him to the situation, and he realized that it was a constant warning of Allâh for his evil design, which he contemplated against the Prophet [pbuh]. He approached the traveling group with a penitent heart and begged the Prophet [pbuh] for forgiveness in all humility. </p>
<p>He addressed the Prophet [pbuh] and his companion, saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your people (the Quraishites) have promised a generous reward to anyone who captures you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He added that he offered them provision, but they declined his offer. They only asked him to screen off their departure and blind the polytheists to their hiding place. Then the Prophet [pbuh] forgave him and confirmed it with a token written by ‘Amir bin Fuhairah on a piece of parchment. </p>
<p>Suraqah hurried back to Makkah and tried to foil the attempts of those who were in pursuit of Muhammad [pbuh] and his noble companions. The sworn enemy was converted into an honest believer.</p>
<p>In a version by Abu Bakr [R], he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We emigrated while the Makkans were in pursuit of us. None caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju‘sham on a horse. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allâh, this one has caught up with us.’ The Prophet [pbuh] replied: 
‘Don’t be cast down; verily, Allâh is with us.’" </p>

<li>The party continued its journey until it reached solitary tents belonging to a woman called Umm Ma‘bad Al-Khuza‘iyah. She was a gracious lady who sat at her tent-door with a mat spread out for any chance traveler that might pass by the way. Fatigued and thirsty, the Prophet [pbuh] and his companions wanted to refresh themselves with food and some milk. </li>
</ol>
<p>The lady told them that the flock was out in the pasture and the goat standing nearby was almost dry. It was a rainless year. The Prophet [pbuh], with her permission, touched its udders, reciting over them the Name of Allâh, and to their great joy, there flowed plenty of milk out of them. The Prophet [pbuh] first offered that to the lady of the house, and he shared what was left with the members of the party. Before he left, he milked the goat, filled the container, and gave it to Umm Ma‘bad. </p>
<p>Later on, her husband arrived with slender goats hardly having any milk in their udders. He was astonished to see milk in the house. His wife told him that a blessed man passed by the way, and then she gave details about his physical appearance and manner of talk. Here Abu Ma‘bad realized on the spot that the man was the one whom Quraish were searching for and asked her to give full description of him. She gave a wonderful account of his physique and manners, to which we will go in detail later in the process of talking about his attributes and merits.  </p>
<p>Abu Ma‘bad, after listening to his wife’s account, expressed a sincere wish to accompany the Prophet [pbuh] whenever that was possible and reiterated his admiration in verses of poetry that echoed all over Makkah to such an extent that the people therein thought it was a jinn inculcating words in their ears. Asma’, daughter of Abu Bakr, on hearing those lines, got to know that the two companions were heading for Madinah. </p>
<p>The short poem opened with thanksgiving to Allâh having given them (the Ma‘bads) the chance to host the Prophet [pbuh] for a while. It then gave an account of the bliss that would settle in the heart of the Prophet’s companion whosoever he was; it closed with an invitation to all mankind to come and see by themselves Umm Ma‘bad, her goat, and the container of milk that would all testify to the truthfulness of the Prophet [pbuh]. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On his way to Madinah, the Prophet [pbuh] met Abu Buraidah, one of those driven by their lust for the reward of Quraish. No sooner did he face the Prophet [pbuh] and talk with him, than he embraced Islam along with seventy of his men. He took off his turban, tied it round his lance, and took it as a banner bearing witness that the angel of security and peace had come to imbue the whole world with justice and fairness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two Emigrants resumed their journey. It was during this time that they met Az-Zubair at the head of a caravan returning from Syria. There was warm greeting, and Az-Zubair presented to them two white garments, which they thankfully accepted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On Monday, 8th Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, the fourteenth year of Prophethood, i.e. September 23rd, 622, the Messenger of Allâh arrived at Quba’. As soon as the news of Muhammad’s arrival began to spread, crowds came flocking out of Madinah. They would come every morning and wait eagerly for his appearance until forced by the unbearable heat of the midday sun to return. </p>
<p>One day they had gone as usual, and after a long wait and watch they retired to the city when a Jew, catching a glimpse of three travelers clad in white winding their way to Madinah, shouted from the top of a hillock: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O you people of Arabia! Your grandfather has come! He, whom you have been eagerly waiting for, has come!" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Muslims immediately rushed holding their weapons, (to defend him). The joyful news soon spread through the city and people marched forward to greet their noble guest. </p>
<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim said: "The shouts of ‘Allâhu Akbar’ (Allâh is Great) resounded in Banu ‘Amr bin ‘Auf. Muhammad’s [pbuh] elation correspondingly increased, but with a rare sense of timing and propriety, called a halt. Serenity enveloped him and the revelation was sent down: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... then verily, Allâh is his Maula (Lord, Master or Protector), and Gabriel, and the righteous among the believers, - and furthermore, the angels - are his helpers." [Al-Qur'an 66:4] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Urwah bin Az-Zubair said: They received the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and went with them to the right. There Banu ‘Amr bin ‘Auf hosted him. That was on Monday, Rabi‘ Al-Awwal. He sat down silent, and Al-Ansar (the Helpers), who had not had the opportunity to see him before, came in to greet him: It is said that the sun became too hot so Abu Bakr stood up to shade him from the hot sun rays. </p>
<p>It was really an unprecedented day in Madinah. The Jews could perceive concretely the veracity of their Prophet Habquq, who said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"God has come from At-Taiman, and the Qudus one from Faran Mount." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad [pbuh] stayed in Quba’ with Kulthum bin Al-Hadm, a hospitable chief of the tribe of ‘Amr bin ‘Awf. Here he spent four days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. It was during this period that the foundation of Quba’ Mosque was laid on the basis of pure piety. ‘Ali hung back in Makkah for three days to return the trusts, on behalf of the Prophet [pbuh], to their respective owners. After that, he started his emigration journey to catch up with him at Quba’. </p>
<p>On Friday morning, the Prophet [pbuh], sent for Bani An-Najjar, his maternal uncles, to come and escort him and Abu Bakr to Madinah. He rode towards the new headquarters amidst the cordial greetings of his Madinese followers who had lined his path. He halted at a place in the vale of Banu Salim and there he performed his prayer.</p><p><a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_3">Previous</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/index.html">Index</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_5">Next</a></p></body>
