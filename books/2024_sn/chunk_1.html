<p>Before the advent of Islam, the religious life of Arabia was characterized by a predominant practice of polytheism, despite a claimed kinship with the monotheistic traditions of Ibrahim (Abraham). The Arabs had long adhered to the worship of Allah and maintained some core beliefs of the Abrahamic faith, such as monotheism, but over time these principles became corrupted. A chief of the Khuza‘a tribe, ‘Amr bin Luhai, played a pivotal role in this transition by introducing idol worship to the region after a visit to Syria, influenced by the local customs. He introduced the idol Hubal to the Ka‘bah, which led to the widespread proliferation of idol worship throughout Makkah and the wider Hijaz region. Various idols received worship across Arabia, fostering a stronghold of polytheistic practices and superstitions that encroached upon the earlier traditions, as people attributed divine intercession and mediating powers to these idols.</p>
<p>This cultural shift was not only a religious downgrade from pure monotheism but also introduced a wealth of idiosyncratic rituals and superstitions deeply intertwined with the social fabric of the time. Practices such as self-devotion to idols, sacrifices on stone altars, and votive offerings were commonplace. Traditions included pilgrimages to these idols and various sacrifices aimed at currying favor for personal or communal benefit. Alongside these practices, the casting of divinatory arrows and reliance on soothsayers and astrologers steered societal decisions, reflecting a deep-rooted superstition within the Arabian community. Despite some remnants of earlier Abrahamic practices, such as pilgrimages and rituals associated with the Holy Sanctuary, polytheism and idolatry ushered in a period characterized by religious confusion and social fragmentation.</p>
<p>Christianity and Judaism, while present, had limited influence. Jewish tribes in Hijaz and Christian enclaves developed in discrete areas such as Najran and Yemen, following migration due to political pressures in nearby regions. However, these religions had little impact on the broader Arabian religious landscape, which was dominated by a hodgepodge of beliefs and practices that lacked the moral and spiritual cohesion promised by pure monotheistic teachings. This religious climate set the stage for the profound transformations brought about by the advent of Islam, which sought to eradicate these entrenched superstitions and re-establish monotheism based on Abrahamic principles, offering a new moral and spiritual framework for the Arabs and humanity at large.</p>
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<h2>The Migration of Jews to Arabia</h2>
<p>The migration of the Jews from Palestine to Arabia passed through two phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first phase occurred around B.C. 587 when some Jews left Palestine for Hijaz and settled in the northern areas due to pressures from the destruction of their temple and captivity in Babylon by King Bukhtanasser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second phase began with the Roman occupation of Palestine under the leadership of Roman Buts in 70 A.D., resulting in a tidal wave of Jewish migration into Hijaz, particularly Yathrib, Khaibar, and Taima’. Here, they made proselytes of several tribes, built forts and castles, and lived in villages.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Judaism managed to play an important role in the pre-Islam political life. When Islam dawned on that land, several famous Jewish tribes had already settled, including Khabeer, Al-Mustaliq, An-Nadeer, Quraizah, and Qainuqa‘. Some versions suggest that there were as many as twenty Jewish tribes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Judaism was introduced into Yemen by someone called As‘ad Abi Karb. He had gone to fight in Yathrib and there embraced Judaism, taking two rabbis from Bani Quraizah to instruct the people of Yemen in this new religion." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judaism found fertile soil there to propagate and gain adherents. After his death, his son Yusuf Dhu Nawas rose to power, attacked the Christian community in Najran, and ordered them to embrace Judaism. When they refused, he ordered that a pit of fire be dug and indiscriminately had all the Christians dropped to burn therein. Estimates say that between 20,000 to 40,000 Christians were killed in that human massacre.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Qur’an related part of that story in Al-Buruj (zodiacal signs) Chapter." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christianity had first made its appearance in Arabia following the entry of the Abyssinian (Ethiopian) and Roman colonists into that country. The Abyssinian colonization forces, in league with Christian missions, entered Yemen as a reaction to Dhu Nawas's iniquities and sought to propagate their faith ardently. They built a church called Yemeni Al-Ka‘bah to direct Arab pilgrimage caravans towards Yemen and attempted to demolish the Sacred House in Makkah. However, Allah punished them and made an example of them, both here and in the hereafter.</p>
<p>A Christian missionary named Fimion, known for his ascetic behavior and miracles, infiltrated Najran, where he called people to Christianity and managed to persuade them to embrace it due to his honesty and truthful devotion. The principal tribes that embraced Christianity included Ghassan, Taghlib, Tai’, and some Himyarite kings, as well as other tribes living on the borders of the Roman Empire. </p>
<p>Magianism was also popular among Arabs living near Persia, Iraq, Bahrain, and some areas on the Arabian Gulf coast. Some Yemenis are reported to have professed Magianism during the Persian occupation. As for Sabianism, excavations in Iraq revealed that it had been popular among Chaldaean folks, the Syrians, and Yemenis. With the advent of Judaism and Christianity, however, Sabianism began to give way to the new religions, although it retained some followers mixed or adjacent to the Magians in Iraq and the Arabian Gulf.</p>
<h2>The Religious Situation</h2>
<p>The state of religious life in Arabia before the advent of Islam was marginal; the polytheists, who faked Abrahamism, were far detached from its precepts and oblivious to its inherent good manners. They plunged into disobedience and ungodliness, developing certain peculiar religious superstitions that influenced the entire region's religious and social-political life.</p>
<p>Judaism had deteriorated into abominable hypocrisy, where rabbis became lords to the exclusion of the Lord, engaging in the dictatorial subjugation of people and seeking wealth and power even at the expense of their religion. Christianity, likewise, opened its doors to polytheism, becoming challenging to comprehend as a heavenly religion and having little impact on the souls of Arabs who professed it, as it was alien to their lifestyles.</p>
<p>People of other religions were similar to the polytheists in their inclinations, dogmas, customs, and traditions.</p>
<h2>Aspects of Pre-Islamic Arabian Society</h2>
<h3>Social Life of the Arabs</h3>
<p>Arabian society was a social medley with various strata. The status of women among the nobility reflected an advanced degree of esteem. Women enjoyed considerable free will, their decisions often enforced, and were cherished so much that blood would often be shed in defense of their honor. </p>
<p>Yet, the family system in Arabia was wholly patriarchal, completely in the hands of a woman's legal guardian, whose words regarding her marital status could never be questioned. Other social strata were marked by rampant indecency and prostitution. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Abu Da’? on the authority of ‘Aishah [R] reported four kinds of marriage in pre-Islamic Arabia."</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first was similar to present-day marriage where a man gives his daughter in marriage to another man after a dowry is agreed on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second involved the husband sending his wife to cohabit with another man to conceive. After conception, her husband could accompany her if he desired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third was where a group of less than ten men would have sexual intercourse with a woman. If she conceived, she would call them, and the child was claimed by one among them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth kind was a practice where numerous men could have sexual intercourse with a certain woman (a whore) who would not prevent anyone. Such women placed a flag at their gates to invite in anyone interested. If one of these women got pregnant, she would summon the men to identify the child's father, determined by a seeress.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] declared Islam, he abolished all these forms except the present Islamic marriage.</p>
<p>Women accompanied men in wars, and the winners would freely engage in intercourse with them, but the children conceived in such a manner suffered disgrace for life. Pre-Islamic Arabs had no limit on the number of wives, allowing for the marriage of two sisters simultaneously or even the wives of their fathers if divorced or widowed. Divorce was primarily in the power of the husband.</p>
<p>The obscenity of adultery was prevalent across all social classes except for a few individuals whose self-dignity prevented them from such acts. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Abu Da’? reported: A man stood up before Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] and stated: 'O Prophet of Allah! That boy is my son. I had sexual intercourse with his mother in the pre-Islamic period.' The Prophet (pbuh) replied: 'No claim in Islam for pre-Islamic affairs. The child is to be attributed to the one on whose bed it was born, and stoning is the lot of a fornicator.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regard to the relationship of pre-Islam Arabs with their offspring, life presented paradoxes. While some cherished their children, others buried female infants alive due to a misguided fear of poverty and shame. However, the practice of infanticide was not uniformly rampant, as there was a dire need for male children for protection.</p>
<p>Another notable aspect of life among the Arabs was a deep-seated emotional attachment to their clans. Tribal pride was one of the strongest passions, and the doctrine of unity of blood bound the Arabs into social unity, often leading to bitter tribal warfare, evidenced by conflicts such as that of Aws and Khazraj, ‘Abs and Dhubyan, and Bakr and Taghlib.</p>
<p>While inter-tribal relationships were often fragile due to the wars, deep devotion to religious superstitions and customs helped curb a thirst for blood. The customary suspension of hostilities during prohibited months (Muharram, Rajab, Dhul-Qa‘dah, and Dhul-Hijjah) allowed for trade and peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>In summary, the Arabs of the pre-Islamic period were immersed in superstition and ignorance, treating women as commodities and engaging in wars driven primarily by avarice for wealth.</p>
<h3>The Economic Situation</h3>
<p>The economic situation mirrored the social atmosphere. Trade was the prevalent means of survival. However, trade journeys could only be fulfilled if security of caravan routes and inter-tribal peace were guaranteed, often absent in Arabia except during the prohibited months when coastal assemblies occurred.</p>
<p>Industry was largely foreign to the Arabian psyche. Most industries available, such as knitting and tanning, were performed by migrants from Yemen, Heerah, or the borders of Syria. Limited farming and stock-breeding existed, mostly involving women spinning yarn. Overall, poverty, hunger, and inadequate clothing characterized Arabia economically.</p>
<h3>Ethics</h3>
<p>Despite a considerable number of evils in pre-Islamic Arabia, there existed praiseworthy virtues:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hospitality</strong>: Arabs took pride in hospitality, dedicating much of their poetry to guest merit. They would sacrifice their sustenance for guests and incur significant burdens to stop bloodshed.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Noble Qur’an does not downplay the sin of wine drinking and gambling but mentions that 'the sin of them is greater than their benefit.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Covenant-Keeping</strong>: To make a promise was akin to entering into debt, with Arabs willing to sacrifice greatly to uphold their word. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sense of Honor</strong>: Arabs had a keen sense of self-esteem and could not tolerate humiliation, often sacrificing themselves to maintain their self-respect. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determination</strong>: An Arab would not give up pursuing pride or honor, even at the cost of his life. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forbearance and Perseverance</strong>: These traits were regarded with great admiration, particularly due to their impetuosity and courage. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Living a pure, uncomplicated life contributed to their truthfulness and honesty, distancing them from intrigue and treachery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These virtues, despite needing rectification in history, were invaluable to future welfare and guided the Arabs towards embracing Islam.</p>
<h2>Lineage and Family of Muhammad [pbuh]</h2>
<p>The lineage of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] has three versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first, authenticated by historians and genealogists, traces Muhammad's genealogy to ‘Adnan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second, which holds certain doubts, goes beyond ‘Adnan back to Abraham.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third version traces back beyond Abraham to Adam.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Prophetic Family</h3>
<p>The family of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] is known as the Hashemite family, named after his grandfather Hashim bin ‘Abd Munaf. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hashim</strong>: He provided food and water to pilgrims. Known for his wealth and honesty, Hashim was called so for crumbling bread for pilgrims. He started Quraish’s two journeys of summer and winter and married Salma from Bani ‘Adi. He died in Ghazza in Palestine in 497 A.D., after which his wife gave birth to ‘Abdul-Muttalib.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>‘Abdul-Muttalib</strong>: After Hashim's death, his brother Al-Muttalib took charge of the pilgrims’ sustenance, and upon his death, ‘Abdul-Muttalib maintained his people’s prestige. He witnessed key events such as the digging of Zamzam well and the Elephant raid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>‘Abdullah</strong>: The father of Prophet Muhammad [pbuh], was chosen for slaughter after a vow by ‘Abdul-Muttalib. He married Amina and died shortly before Muhammad’s birth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Muhammad’s Birth and Early Life</h2>
<h3>His Birth</h3>
<p>Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] was born in Bani Hashim lane in Makkah on Monday morning, the ninth of Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, in 571 A.D. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When he was born, there was a light that issued from my pudendum and lit the palaces of Syria." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was circumcised on his seventh day, and the first woman to suckle him was Thuyebah, the concubine of Abu Lahab.</p>
<h3>Babyhood</h3>
<p>It was a common practice in Arabia for children to be sent to bedouin wet nurses for healthy upbringing. Muhammad [pbuh] was cared for by Haleemah bint Abi Dhuaib. During his time with her, her household experienced much prosperity.</p>
<p>Haleemah returned him to his mother when he was weaned but worried about his health and returned him to her care when he was six. </p>
<h3>Amina’s Death</h3>
<p>Amina took Muhammad [pbuh] to visit his father's grave in Yathrib but fell ill and died on the way back, leaving him under the care of his grandfather ‘Abdul-Muttalib. </p>
<p>When his grandfather passed away, he was taken care of by Abu Talib, who respected him and provided him protection for forty years.</p>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>When Muhammad was twelve, he traveled with Abu Talib to Syria, meeting a monk named Bahira who recognized him as a future prophet. </p>
<p>At 15, he witnessed the sacrilegious wars in which he participated by aiding his uncles but did not engage in battle himself.</p>
<h3>Al-Fudoul Confederacy</h3>
<p>After these wars, a confederacy formed to suppress violence and injustice in Makkah comprised various tribes, including Banu Hashim, which the Prophet [pbuh] later praised.</p>
<h3>Early Job and Marriage</h3>
<p>Muhammad [pbuh] worked as a shepherd before working for Khadijah, who offered him money to trade in Syria. Upon his return, Khadijah, impressed with his honesty and character, married him. They had several children together, though most died at a young age.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding Al-Ka‘bah</h3>
<p>At thirty-five, Muhammad [pbuh] witnessed the reconstruction of Al-Ka‘bah. Due to disputes over placing the Black Stone, he became the arbitrator, ensuring a peaceful solution without violence.</p>
<h3>The Prophet's Character</h3>
<p>Throughout his youth, Muhammad [pbuh] was known for his moral integrity, gaining the title Al-‘Ameen (the trustworthy). His character distinguished him among his people, remembering him as truthful, hospitable, and respectful.</p>
<h2>In the Shade of the Message and Prophethood</h2>
<p>At nearly forty, Muhammad [pbuh] devoted long hours to reflection and meditation in the cave of Hira’ near Makkah. He sought meaning in the moral evils and idolatry within his society, preparing him for the monumental responsibilities that lay ahead.</p>
<h3>Interruption of Revelation</h3>
<p>When Revelation paused briefly, the Prophet [pbuh] experienced deep sadness but was reassured by the angel Gabriel. When the Revelation resumed, it marked a new stage of guidance and communication with Allah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first Revelation sent to the Prophet [pbuh] implied several injunctions, simple in form but highly effective and of serious far-reaching ramifications." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The injunctions among others emphasized the significance of warning against ignorance, magnifying the oneness of Allah, and stressing the importance of purity in thought and action.</p>
<h3>The Call to Islam</h3>
<p>The invitation posed by Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] revolved around the testimony of the oneness of Allah, belief in the Hereafter, sanctifying one's soul, and committing one's life to Allah's ways and His message.</p>
<p>These foundational aspects formed the cornerstone of the message that transformed Arabian society and beyond, guiding them toward acceptance of Islam.</p><p><a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_0">Previous</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/index.html">Index</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_2">Next</a></p></body>
