<p>In this pivotal moment of Islamic history, a malicious plot by the Quraish sought to assassinate the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him (pbuh), but divine intervention facilitated his escape from Makkah. The assassination plan, devised under Abu Jahl's sinister proposal, aimed to disperse the accountability across various tribes, preventing any form of revenge. However, this perilous scheme was revealed to the Prophet by the Archangel Gabriel, leading to an urgent and clandestine migration, or Hijra, to Madinah with his loyal companion, Abu Bakr. Despite the tight watch of assassins lying in wait, Allah's protection allowed the Prophet to safely evade capture, leaving his cousin Ali in his place, and undertaking a secretive route south towards a cave on Mount Thawr to avoid the expected northern path.</p>
<p>During this treacherous journey, the Prophet and Abu Bakr exhibited remarkable faith and resourcefulness, both contributing to the early establishment of a Muslim society in Madinah. Assisted by Abu Bakr’s son Abdullah and other allies, they remained hidden in the cave for three days as they outmaneuvered searches by the Quraishites, motivated by a substantial bounty on their heads. The narrative highlights critical episodes, like their encounter with Suraqah bin Malik, who sought the reward but was turned back after witnessing an evident sign of divine protection which led to his eventual conversion. Moreover, an incident at Umm Ma'bad's camp demonstrated the Prophet's ability to provide, as he miraculously obtained milk from a barren goat, which solidified the trust and admiration of those they encountered along the way.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival in Quba just outside Madinah, the foundations of a new Islamic society were laid, starting with the construction of the Quba mosque—marking the first mosque built in Islamic history. The Prophet's entry into Madinah was met with immense joy and celebration, and he was warmly embraced by its people, particularly the Ansar (Helpers), who were eager to support the new Islamic state. The migration signified not merely a physical relocation but the inception of a transformative phase in Islamic history, setting the stage for the rise of Islam as a socio-political and spiritual influence. Hereafter, the Prophet's efforts in Madinah centered on integrating the newly formed Muslim community, resolving conflicts, and establishing a model society based on Islamic principles.</p>
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>"[pbuh] forgave him and confirmed it with a token written by ‘Amir bin Fuhairah on a piece of parchment. Suraqah hurried back to Makkah and tried to foil the attempts of those who were in pursuit of Muhammad [pbuh] and his noble companions. The sworn enemy was converted into an honest believer." [Bukhari 1/516, 1/554; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/53]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a version by Abu Bakr [R], he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We emigrated while the Makkans were in pursuit of us. None caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju‘sham on a horse. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allâh, this one has caught up with us.’ The Prophet [pbuh] replied: ‘Don’t be cast down, verily, Allâh is with us.’"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The party continued its journey until it reached to solitary tents belonging to a woman called Umm Ma‘bad Al-Khuza‘iyah. She was a gracious lady who sat at her tent-door with a mat spread out for any chance traveller that might pass by the way. Fatigued and thirsty, the Prophet [pbuh] and his companions wanted to refresh themselves with food and some milk. The lady told them that the flock was out in the pasture and the goat standing nearby was almost dry. It was a rainless year. The Prophet [pbuh], with her permission, touched its udders, reciting over them the Name of Allâh, and to their great joy, there flowed plenty of milk out of them. The Prophet [pbuh] first offered that to the lady of the house, and he shared what was left with the members of the party. Before he left, he milked the goat, filled the container and gave it to Umm Ma‘bad. Later on, her husband arrived with slender goats hardly having any milk in their udders. He was astonished to see milk in the house. His wife told him that a blessed man passed by the way, and then she gave details about his physical appearance and manner of talk. Here Abu Ma‘bad realized on the spot that the man was the one whom Quraish were searching for and asked her to give full description of him. She gave a wonderful account of his physique and manners, to which we will go in detail later in the process of talking about his attributes and merits.  </p>
<p>Abu Ma‘bad, after listening to his wife’s account, expressed a sincere wish to accompany the Prophet [pbuh] whenever that was possible, and reiterated his admiration in verses of poetry that echoed all over Makkah to such an extent that the people therein thought it was a jinn inculcating words in their ears. Asma’, daughter of Abu Bakr, on hearing those lines, got to know that the two companions were heading for Madinah. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The short poem opened with thanks giving to Allâh having given them (the Ma‘bads) the chance to host the Prophet [pbuh] for a while. It then gave an account of the bliss that would settle in the heart of the Prophet’s companion whosoever he was; it closed with an invitation to all mankind to come and see by themselves Umm Ma‘bad, her goat and the container of milk that would all testify to the truthfulness of the Prophet [pbuh]."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On his way to Madinah, the Prophet [pbuh] met Abu Buraidah, one of those driven by their lust for the reward of Quraish. No sooner did he face the Prophet [pbuh] and talk with him, than he embraced Islam along with seventy of his men. He took off his turban, tied it round his lance and took it as a banner bearing witness that the angel of security and peace had come to imbue the whole world with justice and fairness. [Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/101]  </p>
<p>The two Emigrants resumed their journey. It was during this time that they met Az-Zubair at the head of a caravan returning from Syria. There was warm greeting and Az-Zubair presented to them two white garments which they thankfully accepted. [Bukhari 1/554]  </p>
<p>On Monday, 8th Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, the fourteenth year of Prophethood, i.e. September 23rd, 622, the Messenger of Allâh arrived at Quba’. [Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/102] </p>
<p>As soon as the news of Muhammad’s arrival began to spread, crowds came flocking out of Madinah. They would come every morning and wait eagerly for his appearance until forced by the unbearable heat of the midday sun to return. One day they had gone as usual, and after a long wait and watch they retired to the city when a Jew, catching a glimpse of three travellers clad in white winding their way to Madinah, shouted from the top of a hillock: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O you people of Arabia! Your grandfather has come! He, whom you have been eagerly waiting for, has come!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Muslims immediately rushed holding their weapons, to defend him. [Bukhari 1/555]. The joyful news soon spread through the city and people marched forward to greet their noble guest. </p>
<p>Ibn Al-Qayyim said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The shouts of ‘Allâhu Akbar’ (Allâh is Great) resounded in Banu ‘Amr bin ‘Auf. Muhammad’s [pbuh] elation correspondingly increased, but with rare sense of timing and propriety, called a halt. Serenity enveloped him and the revelation was sent down:" </p>
<p>"... then verily, Allâh is his Maula (Lord, Master or Protector), and Gabriel, and the righteous among the believers, - and furthermore, the angels - are his helpers." [Al-Qur'an 66:4] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Urwah bin Az-Zubair said: They received the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], and went with them to the right. There Banu ‘Amr bin ‘Awf hosted him. That was on Monday, Rabi‘ Al-Awwal. He sat down silent, and Al-Ansar (the Helpers), who had not had the opportunity to see him before, came in to greet him: It is said that the sun became too hot so Abu Bakr stood up to shade him from the hot sun rays. [Bukhari 1/555] It was really an unprecedented day in Madinah. </p>
<p>The Jews could perceive concretely the veracity of their Prophet Habquq, who said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"God has come from At-Taiman, and the Qudus one from Faran Mount." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad [pbuh] stayed in Quba’ with Kulthum bin Al-Hadm, a hospitable chief of the tribe of ‘Amr bin ‘Awf. Here he spent four days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. It was during this period that the foundation of Quba’ Mosque was laid on the basis of pure piety. ‘Ali hung back in Makkah for three days to return the trusts, on behalf of the Prophet [pbuh], to their respective owners. After that he started his emigration journey to catch up with him at Quba’. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/54; Ibn Hisham 1/493] </p>
<p>On Friday morning, the Prophet [pbuh], sent for Bani An-Najjar, his maternal uncles, to come and escort him and Abu Bakr to Madinah. He rode towards the new headquarters amidst the cordial greetings of his Madinese followers who had lined his path. He halted at a place in the vale of Banu Salim and there he performed his Friday prayer with a hundred others. [Bukhari 1/555]. Meanwhile, the tribes and families of Madinah, the new name for Yathrib and a short form of ‘The Messenger’s Madinah (City)’, came streaming forth, and vied with one another in inviting the noble visitor to their homes. The girls of the Madinese used to chant beautiful verses of welcome rich in all meanings of obedience and dutifulness to the new Messenger. Though not wealthy, every Ansar (Helper) was wholeheartedly eager and anxious to receive the Messenger in his house. It was indeed a triumphal procession. </p>
<p>Around the camel of Muhammad [pbuh] and his immediate followers, rode the chiefs of the city in their best raiment and in glittering armour, everyone saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Alight here O Messenger of Allâh, abide by us." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muhammad [pbuh] used to answer everyone courteously and kindly: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This camel is commanded by Allâh, wherever it stops, that will be my abode."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The camel moved onward with slackened rein, reached the site of the Prophetic Mosque and knelt down. He did not dismount until it rose up again, went on forward, turned back and then returned to kneel down in the very former spot. Here, he alighted in a quarter inhabited by Banu Najjar, a tribe related to the Prophet [pbuh] from the maternal side. In fact, it was his wish to honour his maternal uncles and live among them. The fortunate host, Abu Ayyub Al-Ansari, stepped forward with unbounded joy for the Divine blessing appropriated to him, welcomed the Noble Guest and solicited him to enter his house. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/55]  </p>
<p>A few days later, there arrived the Prophet’s spouse Sawdah, his two daughters Fatimah and Umm Kulthum, Usama bin Zaid, Umm Aiman, ‘Abdullah — son of Abu Bakr with Abu Bakr’s household including ‘Aishah [R]. Zainab was not able to emigrate and stayed with her husband Abi Al-‘As till Badr Battle. [Bukhari 1/556]  </p>
<p>‘Aishah [R] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] arrived in Madinah, both Abu Bakr and Bilal fell ill. I used to attend to their needs. When the fever took firm grip of Abu Bakr he used to recite verses of poetry that smacked of near death; Bilal, when the fit of fever alleviated, would also recite verses of poetry that pointed to clear homesickness." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Aishah [R] added: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I briefed the Prophet [pbuh] on their grave situation, and he replied: O Allâh, we entreat You to establish in our hearts a strong love for Madinah equal to that we used to have for Makkah, or even more. O Allâh, bless and increase the wealth of Madinah and we beseech You to transmute its rotten mud into wholesome edible fat." [Bukhari 1/588]      </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Life in Madinah</h2>
<p>The Madinese era could be divided into three phases: </p>
<ol>
<li>The first phase was characterized by too much trouble and discord, and too many obstacles from within coupled by a hostile wave from without aiming at total extermination of the rising faith. It ended with Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty in Dhul Qa‘da 6 A.H. </li>
<li>The second phase featured a truce with the pagan leadership and ended in the conquest of Makkah in Ramadan 8 A.H. It also witnessed the Prophet [pbuh] inviting kings beyond Arabia to enter the fold of Islam. </li>
<li>In the third phase, people came to embrace Islam in hosts. Tribes and other folks arrived in Madinah to pay homage to the Prophet [pbuh]. It ended at the death of the Prophet [pbuh] in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal 11 A.H.   </li>
</ol>
<h3>The First Phase: The Status Quo in Madinah at the Time of Emigration</h3>
<p>Emigration to Madinah could never be attributable to attempts to escape from jeers and oppression only, but it also constituted a sort of cooperation with the aim of erecting the pillars of a new society in a secure place. Hence it was incumbent upon every capable Muslim to contribute to building this new homeland, immunizing it and holding up its prop. As a leader and spiritual guide, there was no doubt the Noble Messenger [pbuh], in whose hands exclusively all affairs would be resolved. </p>
<p>In Madinah, the Prophet [pbuh] had to deal with three distinctively different categories of people with different respective problems: </p>
<ol>
<li>His Companions, the noble and Allâh fearing elite [R].  </li>
<li>Polytheists still detached from the Islam and were purely Madinese tribes.</li>
<li>The Jews.  </li>
</ol>
<p>As for his Companions, the conditions of life in Madinah were totally different from those they experienced in Makkah. There, in Makkah, they used to strive for one corporate target, but physically, they were scattered, overpowered and forsaken. They were helpless in terms of pursuing their new course of orientation. Their means, socially and materially, fell short of establishing a new Muslim community. In parallel lines, the Makkan Chapters of the Noble Qur’ân were confined to delineating the Islamic precepts, enacting legislations pertaining to the believers individually and enjoining good and piety and forbidding evils and vices. </p>
<p>In Madinah, things were otherwise; here all the affairs of their life rested in their hands. Now, they were at ease and could quite confidently handle the challenges of civilization, construction, means of living, economics, politics, government administration, war and peace, codification of the questions of the allowed and prohibited, worship, ethics and all the relevant issues. In a nutshell, they were in Madinah at full liberty to erect the pillars of a new Muslim community not only utterly different from that pre-Islamic code of life, but also distinctive in its features in the world at large. It was a society that could stand for the Islamic Call for whose sake the Muslims had been put to unspeakable tortures for 10 years. No doubt, the construction of a society that runs in line with this type of ethics cannot be accomplished overnight, within a month or a year. It requires a long time to build during which legislation and legalization will run gradually in a complementary process with mind cultivation, training and education. Allâh, the All-Knowing, of course undertook legislation and His Prophet Muhammad [pbuh], implementation and orientation: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book (this Qur’ân, Islamic laws and Islamic Jurisprudence) and Al-Hikmah (As-Sunna: legal ways, orders, acts of worship, etc. of the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh].)." [Al-Qur'an 62:2] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet’s Companions [R], rushed enthusiastically to assimilate these Qur’ânic rules and fill their hearts joyfully with them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And when His Verses (this Qur’ân) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith." [Al-Qur'an 8:2] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to the Muslims, this task constituted the greatest challenge for the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. In fact, this very purpose lay at the heart of the Islamic Call and the Muhammadan mission; it was never an incidental issue though there were matters that required urgent addressing. </p>
<p>The Muslims in Madinah consisted virtually of two parties: The first one already settled down in their abode, land and wealth, fully at ease, but seeds of discord amongst them were deeply seated and chronic enmity continually evoked; they were Al-Ansar (the Helpers). The second party were Al-Muhajirun (the Emigrants), homeless, jobless and penniless. Their number was not small, on the contrary, it was increasing day by day after the Prophet [pbuh] had given them the green light to leave for Madinah whose economic structure, originally not that prosperous one, began to show signs of imbalance aggravated by the economic boycott that the anti-Islamic groups imposed and consequently imports diminished and living conditions worsened.</p>
<p>The purely Madinese polytheists constituted the second sector with whom the Prophet [pbuh] had to deal. Those people had no control at all over the Muslims. Some of them nursed no grudge against the Muslims, but were rather skeptical of their ancestors’ religious practices, and developed tentative inclination towards Islam and before long they embraced the new faith and were truly devoted to Allâh. However, some others harboured evil intentions against the Prophet [pbuh] and his followers but were too cowardly to resist them publicly; they were rather, under those Islamically favourable conditions, obliged to fake amicability and friendliness. ‘Abdullah bin Ubai, who had almost been given presidency over Al-Khazraj and Al-Aws tribes in the wake of Bu‘ath War between the two tribes, came at the head of that group of hypocrites. The Prophet’s advent and the vigorous rise of the new spirit of Islam foiled that orientation and the idea soon went into oblivion. He, seeing another one, Muhammad [pbuh], coming to deprive him and his agents of the prospective temporal privileges, could not be pleased, and for overriding reasons he showed pretension to Islam but with horrible disbelief deeply-rooted in his heart. He also used to exploit some events and weak-hearted new converts in scheming malevolently against the true believers. </p>
<p>The Jews (the Hebrews), who had migrated to Al-Hijaz from Syria following the Byzantine and Assyrian persecution campaigns, were the third category existent on the demographic scene in Madinah. In their new abode they assumed the Arabian stamp in dress, language and manner of life and there were instances of intermarriage with the local Arabs, however they retained their ethnic particularism and detached themselves from amalgamation with the immediate environment. They even used to pride in their Jewish-Israeli origin, and spurn the Arabs around designating them as illiterate meaning brutal, naïve and backward. They desired the wealth of their neighbours to be made lawful to them and they could thus appropriate it the way they liked.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... because they say: 'There is no blame on us to betray and take the properties of the illiterates (Arabs)'" [Al-Qur'an 3:75] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Religiously, they showed no zeal; their most obvious religious commodity was fortunetelling, witchcraft and the secret arts (blowing on knots), for which they used to attach to themselves advantages of science and spiritual precedence. They excelled at the arts of earning money and trading. They, in fact, monopolized trading in cereals, dates, wine, clothes, export and import. For the services they offered to the Arabs, the latter paid heavily. Usury was a common practice amongst them, lending the Arab notables great sums to be squandered on mercenary poets and in vanity avenues, and in return seizing their fertile land given as surety. They were very good at corrupting and scheming. They used to sow seeds of discord between adjacent tribes and entice each one to hatch plots against the other with the natural corollary of continual exhaustive bloody fighting. Whenever they felt that fire of hatred was about to subside, they would nourish it with new means of perpetuity so that they could always have the upper hand, and at the same time gain heavy interest rates on loans spent on inter-tribal warfare. </p>
<p>Three famous tribes of Jews constituted the demographic presence in Yathrib (now Madinah): Banu Qainuqua‘, allies of Al-Khazraj tribe, Banu An-Nadir and Banu Quraizah who allied Al-Aws and inhabited the suburbs of Madinah. Naturally, they held the new changes with abhorrence and were terribly hateful to them, simply because the Messenger of Allâh was of a different race, and this point was in itself too repugnant for them to reconcile with. Second, Islam came to bring about a spirit of rapport, to terminate the state of enmity and hatred, and to establish a social regime based on denunciation of the prohibited and promotion of the allowed. Adherence to these canons of life implied paving the way for an Arab unity that could work to the prejudice of the Jews and their interests at both the social and economic levels; the Arab tribes would then try to restore their wealth and land misappropriated by the Jews through usurious practices. </p>
<p>The Jews of course deeply considered all these things ever since they had known that the Islamic Call would try to settle in Yathrib, and it was no surprise to discover that they harboured the most enmity and hatred to Islam and the Messenger [pbuh], even though they did not have the courage to uncover their feelings in the beginning. </p>
<p>The following incident could attest clearly to that abominable antipathy that the Jews harboured towards the new political and religious changes that came to stamp the life of Madinah. Ibn Ishaq, on the authority of the Mother of believers Safiyah [R] narrated: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Safiyah, daughter of Huyayi bin Akhtab said: I was the closest child to my father and my uncle Abi Yasir’s heart. Whenever they saw me with a child of theirs, they should pamper me so tenderly to the exclusion of anyone else. However, with the advent of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and setting in Quba’ with Bani ‘Amr bin ‘Awf, my father, Huyayi bin Akhtab and my uncle Abu Yasir bin Akhtab went to see him and did not return until sunset when they came back walking lazily and fully dejected. I, as usually, hurried to meet them smiling, but they would not turn to me for the grief that caught them. I heard my uncle Abu Yasir say to Ubai and Huyayi: 'Is it really he (i.e. Muhammad [pbuh])?' The former said: 'It is he, I swear by Allâh!' 'Did you really recognize him?' they asked. He answered: 'Yes, and my heart is burning with enmity towards him'." [Ibn Hisham 1/518, 519]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting story that took place on the first day, the Prophet [pbuh] stepped in Madinah, could be quoted to illustrate the mental disturbance and deep anxiety that beset the Jews. ‘Abdullah bin Salam, the most learned rabbi among the Jews came to see the Prophet [pbuh] when he arrived, and asked him certain questions to ascertain his real Prophethood. No sooner did he hear the Prophet’s answers than he embraced Islam, but added that if his people knew of his Islamization they would advance false arguments against me. The Prophet [pbuh] sent for some Jews and asked them about ‘Abdullah bin Salam, they testified to his scholarly aptitude and virtuous standing. Here it was divulged to them that he had embraced Islam and on the spot, they imparted categorically opposite testimonies and described him as the most evil of all evils. In another narration ‘Abdullah bin Salam said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Jews! Be Allâh fearing. By Allâh, the only One, you know that he is the Messenger of Allâh sent to people with the Truth." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They replied, "You are lying." This was the Prophet’s first experience with the Jews. [Bukhari 1/459]</p>
<p>That was the demo-political picture within Madinah. Five hundred kilometres away in Makkah, there still lay another source of detrimental threat, the archenemy of Islam, Quraish. For ten years, while at the mercy of Quraish, the Muslims were subjected to all sorts of terrorism, boycott, harassment and starvation coupled with a large scale painstaking psychological war and aggressive organized propaganda. When they had emigrated to Madinah, their land, wealth and property were seized, wives detained and the socially humble in rank brutally tortured. Quraish also schemed and made attempts on the life of the first figure of the Call, Muhammad [pbuh]. Due to their acknowledged temporal leadership and religious supremacy among the pagan Arabs, given the custodianship of the Sacred Sanctuary, the Quraishites spared no effort in enticing the Arabians against Madinah and boycotting the Madinese socially and economically. </p>
<p>To quote Muhammad Al-Ghazali: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A state of war virtually existed between the Makkan tyrants and the Muslims in their abode. It is foolish to blame the Muslims for the horrible consequences that were bound to ensue in the light of that long-standing feud." [Fiqh As-Seerah p.162] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Muslims in Madinah were completely eligible then to confiscate the wealth of those tyrants, mete out for them exemplary punishment and bring twofold retaliation on them in order to deter them from committing any folly against the Muslims and their sanctities. </p>
<p>That was a resume of the major problems that the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] had to face, and the complicated issues he was supposed to resolve. In full acknowledgment, we could safely say that he quite honestly shouldered the responsibilities of Messengership, and cleverly discharged the liabilities of both temporal and religious leadership in Madinah. He accorded to everyone his due portion whether of mercy or punishment, with the former usually seasoning the latter in the overall process of establishing Islam on firm grounds among its faithful adherents.   </p>
<h2>A New Society being built</h2>
<p>We have already mentioned that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] arrived in Madinah on Friday, 12th Rabi‘ Al-Awwal 1 A.H., i.e. September 27th, 622 A.D. and took the downstairs of Abi Ayyub’s house as a temporary residence. </p>
<p>The first task to which the Prophet [pbuh] attended on his arrival in Madinah was the construction of a Mosque, in the very site where his camel knelt down. The land, which belonged to two orphans, was purchased. The Prophet [pbuh] himself contributed to building the Mosque by carrying adobe bricks and stones while reciting verses: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Allâh! no bliss is there but that of the Hereafter, I beseech you to forgive the Emigrants and Helpers." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ground was cleared, of weeds and shrubs, palm trees and rubbish, the graves of the polytheists dug up and then leveled and the trees planted around. The Qiblah (the direction in which the Muslims turn their faces in prayer) was constructed to face Jerusalem; two beams were also erected to hold the ceiling up. It was square in form, each side measuring approximately 100 yards, facing towards the north and having three gates on each of the remaining sides. Nearby, rooms reserved for the Prophet’s household were built of stones and adobe bricks with ceilings of palm leaves. [Bukhari 1/71,555,560; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/56]</p>
<p>To the north of the Mosque, a place was reserved for the Muslims who had neither family nor home. The Adhân (summoning the Muslims to the Mosque by the Call for prayer) was initiated at this early stage of the post-migration era. The Mosque was not merely a locus to perform prayers, but rather an Islamic league where the Muslims were instructed in Islam and its doctrines. It served as an assembly place where the conflicting pre-Islamic trends used to come to terms; it was the headquarter wherein all the affairs of the Muslims were administered, and consultative and executive councils held.</p>
<p>The Mosque being thus constructed, the Prophet [pbuh] next turned his attention to cementing the ties of mutual brotherhood amongst the Muslims of Madinah, Al-Ansar (the Helpers) and Al-Muhajirun (the Emigrants). It was indeed unique in the history of the world. A gathering of 90 men, half of whom were Emigrants and the others Helpers assembled in the house of Anas bin Malik where the Prophet [pbuh] gave the spirit of brotherhood his official blessing. When either of the two persons who had been paired as brothers, passed away, his property was inherited by his brother-in-faith. This practice continued till the following verse was revealed at the time of the battle of Badr, and the regular rule of inheritance was allowed to take its usual course: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But kindred by blood are nearer to one another regarding inheritance." [Al-Qur'an 8:75] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Brotherhood-in-faith," to quote Muhammad Al-Ghazali again, "was holding subordinate every distinction of race and kindred and supporting the Islamic precept: none is superior to the other except on the basis of piety and God-fearing." [Fiqh As-Seerah p140,141] </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] attached to that brotherhood a valid contract; it was not just meaningless words but rather a valid practice relating to blood and wealth rather than a passing whim taking the form of accidental greeting. </p>
<p>The atmosphere of brotherhood and fellow-feeling created a spirit of selflessness infused deeply in the hearts of his followers, and produced very healthy results. For example, Sa‘d bin Ar-Rabi‘, a Helper, said to his fellow brother ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am the richest man amongst the Helpers. I am glad to share my property half and half with you. I have two wives, I am ready to divorce one and after the expiry of her ‘Iddah, (the prescribed period for a woman divorcee to stay within her house unmarried) you may marry her."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf was not prepared to accept anything: neither property nor home. So he blessed his brother and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kindly direct me to the market so that I may make my fortune with my own hands."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he did prosper and got married very shortly by his own labour. [Bukhari 1/553] </p>
<p>The Helpers were extremely generous to their brethren-in-faith. Abu Hurairah reported that they once approached the Prophet [pbuh] with the request that their orchards of palm trees should be distributed equally between the Muslims of Madinah and their brethren from Makkah. But the Prophet [pbuh] was reluctant to put this heavy burden upon them. It was, however, decided that the Emigrants would work in the orchards along with the Helpers and the yield would be divided equally amongst them. [Bukhari 1/312] </p>
<p>Such examples point directly to the spirit of sacrifice, altruism and cordiality on the part of the Helpers, and also to the feeling of appreciation, gratitude and self-respect that the Emigrants held dear to their hearts. They took only what helped them eke a reasonable living. In short, this policy of mutual brotherhood was so wise and timely that many obstinate problems were resolved wonderfully and reasonably.  </p>
<h3>A Charter of Islamic Alliance</h3>
<p>Just as the Prophet [pbuh] had established a code of brotherhood amongst the believers, so too he was keen on establishing friendly relations between the Muslims and non-Muslim tribes of Arabia. He established a sort of treaty aiming at ruling out all pre-Islamic rancour and inter-tribal feuds. He was so meticulous not to leave any area in the charter that would allow pre-Islamic traditions to sneak in or violate the new environment he wanted to establish. Herein, we look over some of its provisions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This is a document from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh, concerning Emigrants and Helpers and those who followed and strove with them." </p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>They are one nation to the exclusion of other people. </li>
<li>The Emigrants of Quraish unite together and shall pay blood money among themselves, and shall ransom honourably their prisoners. Every tribe of the Helpers unite together, as they were at first, and every section among them will pay a ransom for acquitting its relative prisoners. </li>
<li>Believers shall not leave anyone destitute among them by not paying his redemption money or blood money in kind.  </li>
<li>Whoever is rebellious or whoever seeks to spread enmity and sedition, the hand of every God-fearing Muslim shall be against him, even if he be his son.</li>
<li>A believer shall not kill another believer, nor shall support a disbeliever against a believer. </li>
<li>The protection of Allâh is one (and is equally) extended to the humblest of the believers. </li>
<li>The believers are supported by each other. </li>
<li>Whosoever of the Jews follows us shall have aid and succour; they shall not be injured, nor any enemy be aided against them.</li>
<li>The peace of the believers is indivisible. No separate peace shall be made when believers are fighting in the way of Allâh. Conditions must be fair and equitable to all. </li>
<li>It shall not be lawful for a believer, who holds by what is in this document and believes in Allâh and the Day of Judgement, to help a criminal nor give him refuge. Those who give him refuge and render him help shall have the curse and anger of Allâh on the Day of Resurrection. Their indemnity is not accepted. </li>
<li>Whenever you differ about a matter, it must be referred to Allâh and to Muhammad. [Ibn Hisham 1/502,503] </li>
<li>Killing a believer deliberately with no good reason entails killing the killer unless the sponsor deems it otherwise.  </li>
</ol>
<p>It was solely by his wisdom and dexterity that the Prophet [pbuh] erected the pillars of the new society. This phenomenon, no doubt, left its mark on the virtuous Muslims. He used to bring them up in the light of the Islamic education; he sanctified their selves, enjoined them to observe righteousness and praiseworthy manners and was keen on infusing into them the ethics of amity, glory, honour, worship and first and foremost obedience to Allâh and His Messenger. </p>
<p>The following is a cluster of the virtues he used to inculcate in the minds of his followers: </p>
<p>A man asked the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] which of the merits is superior in Islam. He (the Prophet [pbuh]) remarked: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That you provide food and extend greetings to one whom you know or do not know." [Bukhari 1/6,9] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Abdullah bin Salām said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the Prophet [pbuh] arrived in Madinah, I went to see him and I immediately recognized through his features that he would never be a liar. The first things he (the Prophet [pbuh]) said was: 'Extend peace greetings amongst yourselves, provide food to the needy, maintain uterine relations, observe prayer at night while people are asleep, then you will peacefully enter the Garden (Paradise).' " [Narrated by At-Tirmidhi; Mishkat Al-Masabih 1/168] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Muslim is that one from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe." [Bukhari 1/6] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"None amongst you believes (truly) till one likes for his brother that which he loves for himself." [ibid 1/6] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He will not enter Paradise, he whose neighbour is not secure from his wrongful conduct." [Narrated by Muslim; Mishkat Al-Masabih 2/422] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim; he neither oppresses him nor does he fail him. Whosoever removes a worldly grief from a believer, Allâh will remove from him one of the griefs of the Day of Judgement. Whosoever shields a Muslim, Allâh will shield him on the Day of Resurrection." [Mishkat Al-Masabih 2/422; Sahih Al-Bukhari; Sahih Muslim] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Abusing a Muslim is an outrage and fighting against him is disbelief." [Bukhari 2/893] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To remove something harmful from the road, is charity." [Mishkat Al-Masabih 1/12] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Charity erases sins just as water extinguishes fire." [ibid 1/14] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He is not a perfect believer, who goes to bed full and knows that his neighbour is hungry." [ibid 2/424] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Show mercy to people on earth so that Allâh will have mercy on you in heaven." [Sunan Abu Da'ud 2/235] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Try to avert fire even by half a date (in charity) if not by tendering a good word." [Bukhari 2/190] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Clothing an under-clad Muslim, entitles you to a garment from the Paradise; feeding a hungry Muslim will make you eligible (by Allâh’s Will) for the fruit of Paradise, and if you provide water to a thirsty Muslim, Allâh will provide you with a drink from ‘the Sealed Nectar’." [Mishkat Al-Masabih 1/169] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He used as well to exhort the believers to spend in charity reminding them of relevant virtues for which the hearts yearn. </p>
<p>He said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The believers in their mutual love, are like the human body where when the eye is in agony, the entire body feels the pain; when the head aches, all the body will suffer." [Narrated by Muslim] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The bonds of brotherhood between two Muslims are like parts of a house, one part strengthens and holds the other." [Bukhari 2/890] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do not have malice against a Muslim; do not be envious of other Muslims; do not go against a Muslim and forsake him. O the slaves of Allâh! Be like brothers with each other. It is not violable for a Muslim to desert his brother for over three days." [Bukhari 2/896] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] used as well to promote that habit of abstention from asking the others for help unless one is totally helpless. He used to talk to his companions a lot about the merits, virtues and Divine reward implied in observing the prescribed worships and rituals. He would always bring forth corroborated proofs in order to link them physically and spiritually to the Revelation sent to him, hence he would apprise them of their duties and responsibilities in terms of the consequences of the Call of Islam, and at the same time emphasize the exigencies of comprehension and contemplation. </p>
<p>That was his practice of maximizing their morale and imbuing them with the noble values and ideals so that they could become models of virtue to be copied by subsequent generations. </p>
<p>‘Abdullah bin Mas‘ud [R] once said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you are willing to follow a good example, then you can have a recourse in the tradition of the deceased, because the living are likely to fall an easy victim to oppression (so they might waver in faith). Follow the steps of Muhammad’s Companions. They were the best in this nation, the most pious, the most learned and the least pretentious. Allâh chose them to accompany the Prophet [pbuh] and establish His religion. Therefore, it is imperative to get to know their grace, follow their righteous way and adhere as much as you can to their manners and assimilate their biography. They were always on the orthodox path. There is then the great Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] whose moral visible attributes, aspects of perfection, talents, virtues, noble manners and praiseworthy deeds, entitle him to occupy the innermost cells of our hearts, and become the dearest target that the self yearns for. Hardly did he utter a word when his Companions would race to assimilate it and work in its light." [Mishkat Al-Masabih 1/32] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those were the attributes and qualities on whose basis the Prophet [pbuh] wanted to build a new society, the most wonderful and the most honourable society ever known in history. On these grounds, he strove to resolve the longstanding problems and later gave mankind the chance to breathe a sigh of relief after a long wearying journey in dark and gloomy avenues. Such lofty morale lay at the very basis of creating a new society with integrated components immune to all fluctuations of time, and powerful enough to change the whole course of humanity.                   </p>
<h2>A Cooperation and Non-Aggression Pact with the Jews</h2>
<p>Soon after emigrating to Madinah and making sure that the pillars of the new Islamic community were well established on strong bases of administrative, political and ideological unity, the Prophet [pbuh] commenced to establish regular and clearly-defined relations with non-Muslims. All of these efforts were exerted solely to provide peace, security, and prosperity to all mankind at large, and to bring about a spirit of rapport and harmony within his region, in particular. </p>
<p>Geographically, the closest people to Madinah were the Jews. Whilst harbouring evil intentions and nursing a bitter grudge, they showed not the least resistance nor the slightest animosity. The Prophet decided to ratify a treaty with them with clauses that provided full freedom in faith and wealth. He had no intention whatsoever of following severe policies involving banishment, seizure of wealth and land or hostility. </p>
<p>The treaty came within the context of another one of a larger framework relating to inter-Muslim relationships. </p>
<p>The most important provisions of the treaty are the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>The Jews of Bani ‘Awf are one community with the believers. The Jews will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs. </li>
<li>The Jews shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs. </li>
<li>If attacked by a third party, each shall come to the assistance of the other. </li>
<li>Each party shall hold counsel with the other. Mutual relation shall be founded on righteousness; sin is totally excluded. </li>
<li>Neither shall commit sins to the prejudice of the other. </li>
<li>The wronged party shall be aided. </li>
<li>The Jews shall contribute to the cost of war so long as they are fighting alongside the believers. </li>
<li>Madinah shall remain sacred and inviolable for all that join this treaty. </li>
<li>Should any disagreement arise between the signatories to this treaty, then Allâh, the All-High and His Messenger shall settle the dispute. </li>
<li>The signatories to this treaty shall boycott Quraish commercially; they shall also abstain from extending any support to them. </li>
<li>Each shall contribute to defending Madinah, in case of a foreign attack, in its respective area. </li>
<li>This treaty shall not hinder either party from seeking lawful revenge. [Ibn Hisham 1/503,504] </li>
</ol>
<p>Madinah and its suburbs, after the ratification of this treaty, turned into a coalition state, with Madinah proper as capital and Muhammad [pbuh] as ‘president’; authorities lay mainly in the hand of the Muslims, and consequently it was a real capital of Islam. To expand the zone of peace and security the Prophet [pbuh] started to enter into similar treaties with other tribes living around ‘his state’.  </p>
<h2>The Prophet on the Battlefield</h2>
<p>The Quraishites, mortified at the escape of the Prophet [pbuh] along with his devoted companions, and jealous of his growing power in Madinah, kept a stringent watch over the Muslims left behind and persecuted them in every possible way. They also initiated clandestine contacts with ‘Abdullah bin Uabi bin Salul, chief of Madinese polytheists, and president designate of the tribes ‘Aws and Khazraj before the Prophet’s emigration. They sent him a strongly-worded ultimatum ordering him to fight or expel the Prophet, otherwise they would launch a widespread military campaign that would exterminate his people and proscribe his women. [Narrated by Abu Da'ud] </p>
<p>His pride wounded and kingship no longer his, ‘Abdullah bin Uabi bin Salul, a priori responded positively to his Quraishite co-polytheists. He mobilized his supporters to counteract the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] on hearing about this unholy alliance summoned ‘Abdullah and admonished him to be more sensible and thoughtful and cautioned his men against being snared in malicious tricks. [Narrated by Abu Da'ud] The men, on grounds of cowardice or reason, gave up the idea. Their chief, however, seemingly complied, but at heart, he remained a wicked unpredictable accomplice with Quraish and the envious Jews. Skirmishes and provocations started to pave the way for a major confrontation between the Muslims and polytheists. </p>
<p>Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, an outstanding Helper, announced his intention to observe ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) and headed for Makkah. There Omaiya bin Khalaf provided tutelage for him to observe the ritual circumambulation. Abu Jahl, an archenemy of Islam saw him in the Sacred Sanctuary and threatened he would have killed him if he had not been in the company of Omaiya. Sa‘d, fearlessly and defiantly, challenged him to committing any folly at the risk of cutting their caravans off. [Bukhari 2/563] </p>
<p>Provocative actions continued and Quraish sent the Muslims a note threatening to put them to death in their own homeland. Those were not mere words, for the Prophet [pbuh] received information from reliable sources attesting to real intrigues and plots being hatched by the enemies of Islam. Precautionary measures were taken and a state of alertness was called for, including the positioning of security guards around the house of the Prophet [pbuh] and strategic junctures. ‘Aishah [R] reported that Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] lay down on bed during one night on his arrival in Madinah and said: Were there a pious person from amongst my Companions who should keep a watch for me during the night? She (‘Aishah [R]) said: We were in this state when we heard the clanging noise of arms. He (the Prophet [pbuh]) said: Who is it? He said: This is Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas. Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] said to him: What brings you here? Thereupon he said: I harboured fear (lest any harm should come to) Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh], so I came to serve as your sentinel. Allâh’s Messenger [pbuh] invoked blessings upon him and then he slept. [Muslim 2/280; Bukhari 1/404] </p>
<p>This state of close vigilance continued ceaselessly until the Words of Allâh were revealed saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allâh will protect you from mankind." [Al-Qur'an 5:67] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the Prophet [pbuh] peeped from the dome of his house asking his people to go away, and making it clear that Allâh would take the charge of protecting him. [At-Tirmidhi 2/130] </p>
<p>The Prophet’s life was not the only target of the wicked schemes, but rather the lives and the whole entity of the Muslims. When the Madinese provided the Prophet [pbuh] and his Companions with safe refuge, the desert bedouins began to look at them all in the same perspective, and outlawed all the Muslims. </p>
<p>At this precarious juncture with Quraish intent on pursuing their aggressive and devilish plans, Allâh, the All-High, gave the Muslims the permission to take arms against the disbelievers: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Permission to fight is given to those (i.e. believers against those disbelievers), who are fighting them, (and) because they (believers) have been wronged, and surely Allâh is Able to give them (believers) victory." [Al-Qur'an 22:39] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse was revealed in a larger context of Divine instructions to eradicate all aspects of falsehood, and hold in honour the symbols and rites of Allâh: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) order for Iqamat-as-Salât: [i.e. to perform Salât (prayer) — the five compulsory, congregational prayers (the males in Mosques)], to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity), and they enjoin Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’ân as the Law of their country in all the spheres of life]." [Al-Qur'an 22:41]. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doubtlessly, the permission to fight was revealed in Madinah after emigration, not in Makkah, still the exact date whereof is in doubt. </p>
<p>The permission to fight was already there, but in the light of the status quo, it was wise for the Muslims to bring the commercial routes leading to Makkah under their control. To realize this strategic objective, the Prophet [pbuh] had to choose either of two options: </p>
<p>a. Entering into non-aggression pacts with the tribes inhabiting either the areas adjacent to the routes or between these routes and Madinah. With respect to this course of action, the Prophet [pbuh] had already signed, together with the Jews and other neighbouring tribes, the aforementioned pact of cooperation and good neighbourliness. </p>
<p>b. Dispatching successive armed missions for harassment along the strategic commercial routes.   </p>
<h3>Pre-Badr Missions and Invasions</h3>
<p>With a view to implementing these plans, the Muslims commenced real military activities, which at first took the form of reconnaissance patrols delegated to explore the geopolitical features of the roads surrounding Madinah and others leading to Makkah, and building alliances with the tribes nearby. The Prophet wanted to impress upon the polytheists and Jews of Madinah as well as the bedouins in its vicinity that the Muslims had smashed their old fears, and had been too strong to be attacked with impunity. He also wanted to display the power of his followers in order to deter Quraish from committing any military folly against him which might jeopardize their economic life and means of living, and to stop them from persecuting the helpless Muslims detained in Makkah, consequently he would avail himself of this opportunity and resume his job of propagating the Divine Call freely. </p>
<p>The following is a resume of these missions and errands: </p>
<ol>
<li>Saif Al-Bahr Platoon sent in Ramadan 1 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. led by Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib and comprising 30 Emigrants with a definite task of intercepting a caravan belonging to Quraish. It was a caravan of 300 people including Abu Jahl bin Hisham. The two parties encountered each other and aligned in preparation for fighting. Majdi bin ‘Amr, on good terms with both sides, happened to be there and managed to prevent an imminent clash.  </li>
</ol>
<p>On that occasion, the Prophet [pbuh] accredited the first flag in the history of Muslims. It was white in colour and was entrusted to Kinaz bin Husain Al-Ghanawi, to carry. </p>
<ol>
<li>In Shawwal, 1 A.H., i.e. April 623 A.D. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] despatched ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Harith bin Al-Muttalib at the head of 60 horsemen of Emigrants to a spot called Batn Rabegh where they encountered Abu Sufyan at the head of a caravan of 200 men. There was arrow shooting but no actual fighting.  </li>
</ol>
<p>It is interesting to note that two Muslims, Al-Miqdad bin ‘Amr Al-Bahrani and ‘Utbah bin Ghazwan Al-Mazini, defected from the caravan of Quraish and joined the ranks of ‘Ubaidah. The Muslims had a white flag carried by Mistah bin Athatha bin Al-Muttalib bin ‘Abd Munaf. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In Dhul Qa‘dah 1 A.H., i.e. May 623 A.D. the Prophet [pbuh] despatched Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas at the head of 20 horsemen, and instructed them not to go beyond Al-Kharrar. After a five-day march they reached the spot to discover that the camels of Quraish had left the day before; their flag, as usual, was white and carried by Al-Miqdad bin ‘Amr. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ghazwa Al-Abwa’ or Waddan. It was in Safar 2 A.H., i.e. 623 A.D. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] set out himself at the head of 70 men, mostly Emigrants, to intercept a camel caravan belonging to Quraish, leaving behind Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah to dispose of the affairs in Madinah. When he reached Waddan, a place between Makkah and Madinah, he found none.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the process of this campaign, he contracted a non-aggression pact with ‘Amr bin Makhshi Ad-Damari. The provisions of the pact go as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a document from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh concerning Bani Damrah in which he established them safe and secure in their wealth and lives. They can expect support from the Muslims unless they oppose the religion of Allâh. They are also expected to respond positively in case the Prophet sought their help." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the first invasion under the leadership of the Messenger of Allâh. It took fifteen days, with a white flag carried by Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib.</p><p><a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_4">Previous</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/index.html">Index</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_6">Next</a></p></body>
