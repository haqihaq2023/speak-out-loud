<p>The account recounts the aftermath of the Battle of Badr, a significant confrontation between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, highlighting both the victory of the Muslim forces and the repercussions among their enemies. In this confrontation, the Muslims faced minor casualties compared to the heavy losses and humiliation sustained by the polytheists, including the death of some of Mecca's key figures, such as Abu Jahl. </p>
<p>The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, showed his sorrow over their disbelief as he addressed the bodies of the fallen Quraysh leaders, affirming that they could still hear his admonishments. This decisive battle shifted the focus to how different communities — such as those in Mecca and Madinah, including Jews and hypocrites — reacted to this outcome. While Mecca experienced deep shame and a thirst for revenge, the Muslims in Madinah received the victory news with joy and gratitude, acknowledging Allah's support.</p>
<p>The narrative continues by detailing how the newfound victory and power prompted various military maneuvers and adjustments in Islamic practices. For instance, issues like the distribution of spoils of war arose among the Muslims, leading to a Divine revelation that clarified the matter. Additionally, the preference for ransoming prisoners over executing them was addressed through a Qur’anic warning, revealing a balancing act between mercy and decisiveness in warfare. </p>
<p>This guidance also extended to the ethical treatment of captives, stressing respect and kindness, as exemplified by Muslims offering their better food to the prisoners. Alongside these developments, the Prophet Muhammad's return to Madinah as a military figure saw him welcomed enthusiastically by the locals, which bolstered both the numerical and moral strength of the Islamic community. Such victories further inspired conversions to Islam, strengthening the community and laying the groundwork for subsequent encounters with adversaries.</p>
<p>Following Badr, the Muslims had to remain vigilant against recurring threats, including internal discord and external hostilities. The Jews in Madinah, witnessing the change in power dynamics, started causing disruptions, highlighted by an incident where a Jewish elder attempted to incite past tribal animosities among the Muslims. </p>
<p>The Banu Qainuqa, one of the Jewish tribes within Madinah, openly breached the existing covenant by provoking and insulting the Muslims and engaging in acts potentially leading to warfare. Despite the Prophet Muhammad’s attempts at peaceful negotiations and warnings to desist from such behavior, Banu Qainuqa defied the admonitions, indicating their readiness for conflict. This ongoing tension underscored the precarious nature of establishing a cohesive Islamic state amid diverse and often hostile stakeholders.</p>
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<h3>The Question of the Spoils of War</h3>
<p>The question of the spoils of war was resolved and the principles and basics relevant to this issue were clearly defined. The laws and rules pertinent to war and peace were legalized and codified, especially at this advanced stage of the Islamic action. Allâh wanted the Muslims to follow war ethics dissimilar to those of pre-Islamic practices. The Muslims are deemed to outdo the others in ethics, values, and fine ideals. He wants to impress on the world that Islam is not merely a theoretical code of life; it is rather mind cultivation-orientated practical principles. </p>
<p>In this context, He established inter and intra-state relations. The fast of Ramadan was established as an obligatory observance in the year 2 A.H., appended by the duty imposed upon Muslims of paying Zakat (alms tax, poor-due) in order to alleviate the burden of the needy Emigrants. A wonderful and striking coincidence was the establishment of Shawwal ‘Eid (the Festival of the Fast-Breaking) directly after the manifest victory of Badr. </p>
<p>It was actually the finest spectacle ever witnessed of Muslims leaving their houses praying, acclaiming Allâh’s Name and entertaining His praise at the top of their voices in recognition of His favour and grace and, last but not least, the support He rendered them and through which the forces of the Truth overpowered those of evil. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the land, and were afraid that men might kidnap you, but He provided a safe place for you, strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things so that you might be grateful." [Al-Qur'an 8:26]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Military Activities between Badr and Uhud</h3>
<p>The Battle of Badr was the first armed encounter between the Muslims and Quraish. It was, in fact, a decisive battle that gained the Muslims a historic victory acknowledged by all the Arabs and dealt a heavy blow to the religious and economic interests of the polytheists. There were also the Jews, who regarded each Islamic victory as a heavy blow to their religioeconomic entity. Both parties were burning with rage and fury since the Muslims had achieved that great victory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers (Muslims) the Jews and Al-Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolators, and disbelievers, etc.)." [Al-Qur'an 5:82]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both resentful parties had their more indignant suites in the form of hypocrites who faked Islam just to save their faces; at the head of whom came ‘Abdullah bin Ubai and his retinue. The desert bedouins living in tents pitched in the vicinity of Madinah, who depended on plundering and looting as a means of living, were totally indifferent to this axial question of belief and disbelief. Their worry derived from fear of losing their perverted avenues of subsistence in case a powerful nascent Muslim state should rise up and put an end to such ill-practices, hence the grudge they nursed against Islam and the Muslims, in general, and the person of Muhammad [pbuh], in particular. </p>
<p>The whole cause of Faith was thus at stake with four furious parties laying ambushes against the new religion, each in its style: pretension to Islam embedded with conspiracy plots and provocative deeds within Madinah, explicitly uncovered animosity pregnant with indignation and the fire of rage on the part of the Jews, and there in Makkah open and persistent calls for vengeance coupled with open intentions to mobilize all potential resources available to silence the voice of Islam once and for all. This was later translated into military action, Uhud Invasion, which left a very bad impression on the good name and esteem that the Muslims were painstakingly working to merit and preserve. </p>
<p>The Muslims were always obliged to be on the lookout for any hostile movements, and it was imperative on them to launch pre-emptive strikes in all directions in order to enjoy a reasonable degree of security in this great instability-provoking ocean of unrest. The following is a list of military activities conducted in the post-Badr era:</p>
<h4>Al-Kudr Invasion</h4>
<p>The scouting body of Madinah reported that Banu Saleem of Ghatafan were engaged in mustering troops to invade the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] took the initiative himself and mounted a surprise attack on them in their own homeland at a watering place called Al-Kudr. Banu Saleem, on receiving the news, had fled before he arrived. He stayed there for three days, took their 500 camels as booty, and distributed them to the fighters after he had set aside the usual one-fifth; each one gained two camels. This invasion took place in Shawwal in the year 2 A.H., seven days after the event of Badr.</p>
<h4>An Attempt on the Life of the Prophet [pbuh]</h4>
<p>The impact of defeat at Badr was so great that the Makkans began to burn with indignation and resentment over their horrible losses. To resolve this situation, two polytheists volunteered to quench their thirst and muffle the source of that humiliation, i.e., the Prophet [pbuh]. ‘Umair bin Wahab Al-Jumahi, a terrible polytheist, and archenemy Safwan bin Omaiyah sat together privately lamenting their loss and remembering their dead and captives. </p>
<p>‘Umair expressed a fervent desire to kill the Prophet [pbuh] and release his captured son in Madinah, if it was not for the yoke of debts he was under and the large family he had to support. Safwan, also had his reasons to see the Prophet [pbuh] killed, so he offered to discharge ‘Umair’s debts and support his family if he went on with his plan. ‘Umair agreed and asked Safwan to be reticent about the whole scheme. </p>
<p>He left for Madinah, having with him a sword to which he applied some kind of lethal poison. ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab saw him at the door of the Mosque and understood that he had come with evil intentions. He immediately went into the Mosque and informed the Prophet [pbuh]. He was let in looped by the sling of his sword and in greeting he said, "good morning," to which the Prophet [pbuh] replied that Allâh had been Gracious and taught them the greeting of the dwellers of Paradise: "peace be upon you!" </p>
<p>To a question raised by the Prophet [pbuh] about his object, ‘Umair said that he had come to see that his captured son was well treated. As for the sword, which the Prophet [pbuh] asked him about, he cursed it and said that it gained them nothing. Upon exhorting him to tell his real goal, he remained obdurate and did not divulge the secret meeting with Safwan. </p>
<p>Here the Prophet [pbuh] got impatient and revealed to ‘Umair his secret mission. ‘Umair was taken by surprise, and incredible astonishment seized him, and he immediately bore witness to the Messengership of Muhammad [pbuh]. He then began to entertain Allâh’s praise for having been guided to the ‘Straight Path’. The Prophet [pbuh] was pleased and asked his Companions to teach ‘Umair the principles of Islam, recite to him the Noble Qur’ân, and release his son from captivity. </p>
<p>Safwan, meanwhile, was still entertaining false illusions as to the approaching redemption of honour, and burying the memory of Badr into oblivion. He was impatiently awaiting ‘Umair’s news but, to his great surprise, he was told that the man had embraced Islam and changed into a devoted believer. ‘Umair later came back to Makkah where he started to call people unto Islam and he did manage to convert many Makkans into Islam.</p>
<h4>Invasion of Bani Qainuqa</h4>
<p>We have already spoken about the treaty that the Prophet [pbuh] signed with the Jews. He was very careful to abide by it to the letter and the Muslims did not show the least violation of any of its provisions. The Jews, however, whose natural disposition is closely linked to treachery, betrayal, and covenant-breaching, could not rid themselves of their tradition, and started a process of intrigues and trouble-making with the aim of producing schism in the growing solid Muslim ranks. </p>
<p>Here is a relevant model of their behaviour: Shas bin Qais, an elderly Jew, a terrible disbeliever, and a greatly envious man of the Muslims, passed by a group of Muhammad [pbuh]’s followers of Aws and Khazraj. He perceived a prevalent spirit of reconciliation and an atmosphere of rapport and amity enveloping the whole group; an unusual scene categorically in conflict with the animosity and hatred that characterized their pre-Islam behaviour. He, therefore, sent a youth of his to sit among them, remind them of Bu‘ath war between them, and recite some of their verses which they used to compose satirizing each other; all of this with the intention of sowing the seeds of discord and disagreement and undermining the new Islamically oriented inter-tribal relations. </p>
<p>The youth did indeed succeed, and the two parties at no time recalled the old days, and pre-Islam tribal fanaticism sprang to the front to bring about a state of war. The Prophet [pbuh] was reported of this account and immediately, at the head of some Emigrants, set out to see to the situation. He began to rebuke them but in the manner of the great instructor and the tolerant spirit of the understanding guide: "O, Muslims! Do you still advance pre-Islamic arguments after I have been sent to you (as a Messenger)? Remember that it is not rightful for you to turn backward after Allâh has guided you to the Straight Path, delivered you from disbelief, and created amity between you." </p>
<p>The Muslims readily realized that it was a Satanic whim and a plot hatched by the enemies. They directly embraced each other and went back home quite satisfied and in full obedience to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. Such were the practices of the Jews, trouble-making, dissension-sowing, falsehood-fabrication, faking belief in the day, and practising disbelief at night. </p>
<p>In everyday life, they used to tighten the ropes of financial dealings on the Muslims. If they happened to owe a Muslim something, they would shirk their obligations on grounds that he had converted into a new religion and they would allege the basis of agreement was no longer valid. If it were the other way, they would never cease to harass him day and night to pay back the debt, all of which was in a desperate attempt to demolish the great edifice of the new religion that was rapidly gaining ground and speedily towering up skyward.  </p>
<h4>The Qainuqa Jews Breach the Covenant</h4>
<p>Seeing that Allâh sided with the believers and granted them a manifest victory and perceiving the Muslims’ awesome presence in Madinah, the Jews could no longer contain themselves or conceal indignation. They started a series of provocative and harmful deeds publicly. The most wicked amongst them were the tribe of Banu Qainuqa, who lived in quarters within Madinah named after them. </p>
<p>As for jobs, they took up goldsmithery, blacksmithing, and crafts of making household instruments; that is why war weaponry was available in large quantities in their houses. They counted 700 warriors and were the most daring amongst the Jewish community in Arabia, and now the first to breach the covenant of cooperation and non-aggression which they had already countersigned with the Prophet [pbuh]. Their behaviour grew too impolite and unbearable. </p>
<p>They started a process of trouble-making, jeering at the Muslims, hurting those who frequented their bazaars, and even intimidating their women. Such things began to aggravate the general situation, so the Prophet [pbuh] gathered them in assemblage, admonished, and called them to be rational, sensible, and guided, and cautioned against further transgression. Nevertheless, they remained obdurate and paid no heed to his warning and said: "Don’t be deluded on account of defeating some Quraishites inexperienced in the art of war. If you were to engage us in fight, you will realize that we are genuine war experts." </p>
<p>In this regard, the Words of Allâh were revealed, saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]) to those who disbelieve: 'You will be defeated and gathered together to Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest.’ There has already been a Sign for you (O Jews) in the two armies that met (in combat — i.e. the battle of Badr): One was fighting in the cause of Allâh, and as for the other (they) were disbelievers. They (the believers) saw them (the disbelievers) with their own eyes twice their number (although they were thrice their number). And Allâh supports with His Victory whom He pleases. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand." [Al-Qur'an 3:12,13]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer of Banu Qainuqa amounted, as seen, to a war declaration. The Prophet [pbuh] suppressed his anger and advised the Muslims to be patient and forbearing and wait for what time might reveal. </p>
<p>The Jews went too far in their transgression, presumptuous behaviour, and licentious practices. One day, a Jewish goldsmith provoked a Muslim woman whose genitals became uncovered when he had tied the edge of the garment to her back. A Muslim man happened to be there and killed the man; the Jews retaliated by killing that Muslim. The man’s family called the Muslims for help, and war started. On Saturday, Shawwal 15th, 2 A.H., the Prophet [pbuh] marched out with his soldiers, Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib, carrying the standard of the Muslims and laid siege to the Jews’ forts for 15 days. Allâh cast fear into their hearts, and they were obliged to defer to the Messenger [pbuh]’s judgement on their lives, wealth, women, and children; their hands were tied behind their backs. </p>
<p>At this point, ‘Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul started his hypocritical role and began to intercede for them persistently on grounds of former alliances between those Jews and his tribe Khazraj. Muhammad [pbuh] dealt with this man as being a Muslim -- he had faked conversion into Islam for only one month. By that time, he granted him his request; for Islam accepts people at their face value. </p>
<p>Banu Qainuqa handed over all materials, wealth, and war equipage to the Prophet [pbuh], who set aside one-fifth and distributed the rest to his men. After that, they were banished out of all Arabia to Azru‘a in Syria, where they stayed for a while and soon perished away.  </p>
<h4>As-Sawiq Invasion</h4>
<p>Two-pronged hostile activities were being conducted independently against the Prophet [pbuh]; plots and intrigues were being hatched by Safwan bin Omaiyah, the hypocrites, and Jews on one hand, going on and on parallel lines with military hostilities being prepared by Abu Sufyan aiming at saving the face of his people and impressing on the other Arabs that Quraish was still a military power to be counted for. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of Badr, Abu Sufyan was burning for revenge and took a solemn vow he would never bathe off impurity unless he had avenged himself on Muhammad [pbuh] and his followers. He set out at the head of 200 men towards Madinah but was not brave enough to attack it in broad daylight. Instead, he resorted to acts of piracy that are performed in the dark. He infiltrated into the Prophet [pbuh]’s town and went to see an old ally Huyai bin Akhtab, who was too cowardly to let him in, so he left for Salam bin Mashkam, chief of Bani Nadeer, a tribe of Jews. </p>
<p>The Jew entertained and gave him a full account of the situation therein. Late at night, he despatched a group of his men to raid Al-‘Uraid, a suburb of Madinah. There, the men felled and burnt the palm trees, killed two Muslims, and then took swiftly to their heels. On hearing the news, the Prophet [pbuh] gathered his men and set out at their heels but could not catch them. The Muslims brought back the provisions (Sawiq, a kind of barley porridge) which the polytheists had thrown aside in order to lighten their loads and hasten their escape; hence this campaign was called the As-Sawiq Invasion. It took place in Dhul-Hijjah 2 A.H., two months after the event of Badr. </p>
<h4>Dhi Amr Invasion, Muharram, 3 A.H.</h4>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh]’s intelligence personnel reported that Banu Tha‘labah and Banu Muhârib were mustering troops with the aim of raiding the outskirts of Madinah. The Prophet [pbuh], at the head of 450 horsemen and footmen, set out to handle this new situation. ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan was asked to dispose of the affairs of the Muslims in Madinah. On their way, they captured a man who embraced Islam and acted as a guide for the army. When the enemies heard of the approach of the Muslims, they hurriedly dispersed into the mountains and disappeared. The Muslims encamped at a watering place called "Dhi Amr" for the whole month of Safar, 3 A.H. The Prophet [pbuh] aimed to impress upon the desert bedouins in the area that the Muslims were then powerful enough to cast fear and awe into the hearts of their enemies. </p>
<h4>Ka‘b bin Al-Ashraf, Killed</h4>
<p>Ka‘b bin Al-Ashraf was the most resentful Jew at Islam and the Muslims, the keenest on inflicting harm on the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and the most zealous advocate of waging war against him. He belonged to the Tai’ tribe, but his mother was from Banu Nadeer. He was a wealthy man known for his handsomeness and a poet living in luxury in his fort southeast of Madinah at the rear of Banu Nadeer’s habitations. </p>
<p>On hearing the news of Badr, he got terribly exasperated and swore that he would prefer death to life if the news were true. When this was confirmed, he wrote poems satirizing Muhammad [pbuh], eulogizing Quraish and enticing them against the Prophet [pbuh]. He then rode to Makkah where he started to trigger the fire of war, and kindle rancour against the Muslims in Madinah. </p>
<p>When Abu Sufyan asked him which religion he was more inclined to, the religion of the Makkans or that of Muhammad [pbuh] and his companions, he replied that the pagans were better guided. With respect to this situation, Allâh revealed His Words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They believe in Jibt and Taghût, and say to the disbelievers that they are better guided as regards the way than the believers (Muslims)." [Al-Qur'an 4:51]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then returned to Madinah to start a fresh campaign of slanderous propaganda that took the form of obscene songs and amatory sonnets with a view to defaming the Muslim women. </p>
<p>At this stage, the situation became unbearable and could no longer be put up with. The Prophet [pbuh] gathered his men and said: "Who will kill Ka‘b bin Al-Ashraf? He had maligned Allâh and His Messenger." Thereupon, Muhammad bin Maslamah, ‘Abbad bin Bishr, Al-Harith bin Aws, Abu ‘Abs bin Hibr, and Salkan bin Salamah, Ka‘b’s foster brother, volunteered to do the job. </p>
<p>Muhammad bin Maslamah said: "O Messenger of Allâh, do you wish that I should kill him?" He said: "Yes." He said: "Permit me to talk (to him in the way I deem fit)." He said: "Talk (as you like)." So, Muhammad bin Maslamah came to Ka‘b and talked to him, saying: "This man (i.e. the Prophet [pbuh]) has made up his mind to collect charity (from us) and this has put us to a great hardship." When he heard this, Ka‘b said: "By Allâh, you will be put to more trouble by him." </p>
<p>Muhammad bin Maslamah answered: "No doubt, now we have become his followers and we do not like to forsake him until we see what turn his affairs will take. I want you to give me a loan." He said: "What will you mortgage?" Muhammad answered: "What do you want?" The immoral and heartless Jew demanded women and children as articles of security against the debt. Muhammad said: "Should we pledge our women whereas you are the most handsome of the Arabs; and the son of one of us may be abused by saying that he was pledged for two wasq (measurement unit of weight) of dates but we can pledge you (our) weapons." Ka‘b agreed. </p>
<p>Salkan bin Salamah, Abu Na’ilah, at another time, went to see Ka‘b for the same purpose and there were more or less the same subjects, only that Abu Na’ilah would bring him some companions. The plan was successful and provided for the presence of both men and weapons. On Rabi‘ Al-Awwal 14th, at night, in the year 3 A.H., the people bid goodbye to the Prophet [pbuh] and set out in the Name of Allâh to implement the carefully drawn plan. The Prophet [pbuh] stayed back praying for them and supplicating Allâh to render them success. </p>
<p>The men went and called upon him at night. He came down although his wife warned him not to meet them, alleging that: "I hear a voice which sounds like the voice of murder." He said: "It is only Muhammad bin Maslamah and my foster brother Abu Na’ilah. When a gentleman is called at night even if he be pierced with a spear, he should respond to the call." </p>
<p>Abu Na’ilah said to his companions: "As he comes down, I will extend my hand towards his head to smell, and when I hold him fast, you should do your job." So when he came down, they talked together for about an hour. They then invited him to go out and spend a nice time in the moonlight. On the way out, Abu Na’ilah remarked: "I smell the nicest perfume from you." Ka‘b said: "Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most scented of the women of Arabia." </p>
<p>Abu Na’ilah, again, said: "Allow me to smell (the scent on your head)." He said: "Yes, you may smell." So he caught it and smelt. Then he said: "Allow me to do so (once again)." He then held his head fast and said to his companions: "Do your job." And they killed him. The group of men came back after fulfilling their mission. One of them, Al-Harith bin Aws, was wounded by mistake with the swords of his men and was bleeding badly. When they reached Baqee‘ Al-Gharqad, they shouted, "Allâh is Great." The Prophet [pbuh] heard them and realized that they had killed the enemy of Allâh. As they saw him, he said: "Cheerful faces are yours." In reply, they said: "And yours, O Messenger of Allâh." They handed the head of the tyrant over to him. He entertained Allâh’s praise for their success. He then applied his saliva to Al-Harith’s wound and it healed on the spot.</p>
<p>When the Jews learned about the death of their tyrant, Ka‘b bin Al-Ashraf, they were scared and even their stonelike hearts were in the grip of inexpressible panic. They realized that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] would thenceforth never hesitate to use force when good words and admonition failed. They remained silent and resigned, and faked adherence to covenants. Now the Prophet [pbuh] was free to collect his thoughts and give himself up to resolving foreign affairs, and facing dangers that could be carried with hostile winds blowing again from Makkah.  </p>
<h3>The Invasion of Buhran</h3>
<p>In Rabi‘ Ath-Thani, the year 3 A.H., the Prophet [pbuh] led a campaign comprising 300 warriors to Buhran in the area of Al-Furu‘. He stayed there till Jumada Al-Ula, 3 A.H. No fighting took place in the process of this patrolling invasion. </p>
<h4>Zaid bin Harithah Leads a Campaign on the Trade Routes of Quraish</h4>
<p>This was the most successful campaign prior to the Uhud Battle. It took place in Jumada Ath-Thaniyah, the year 3 A.H. Summer approached, and it was high time for the Makkan trade caravans to leave for Syria. The people of Quraish, whose lives depended mainly on a mercantile economy consisting of summer caravans to Syria and winter caravans to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), were now at a loss as to what route they would have to follow in order to avoid the backbreaking military strikes that the Muslims successfully inflicted on the polytheists. </p>
<p>They held a meeting to discuss the chances of escaping the economic blockade and decided to go along a trade route across Najd to Iraq. Furat bin Haiyan was appointed as a guide for the caravan. Safwan bin Omaiyah led the caravan along the new route. News of the meeting leaked out through Na‘im bin Mas‘ud Al-Ashja‘i under the effect of wine, and it flew fast to Madinah by Sulit bin An-Nu‘man. The Prophet [pbuh] immediately mustered 100 horsemen under the leadership of Zaid bin Harithah Al-Kalbi and despatched them to intercept and capture the caravan. </p>
<p>They caught up with the camels at a place called Al-Qardah. They took the polytheists by surprise and arrested their guide and two other men. Safwan and his guards fled away without showing the least resistance. The caravan was carrying silver and wares whose value amounted to 100 thousand dirhams. The booty was distributed among the Muslim warriors after one-fifth had been set aside for the Prophet [pbuh]. Furat bin Haiyan embraced Islam out of his own sweet free will. </p>
<p>As a result of this episode, the Muslims foiled Quraish’s plans to find a new trade route. The economic siege laid to Makkah was thus consolidated and had a great impact on the mercantile economy of Makkah. The Makkans were terribly anxious and worried about their prospects of life now at stake with no hope whatsoever for any possible rehabilitation of commercial life or redemption of former prestige at the socio-political level except through two avenues categorically contrasting: relinquishing all symbols of arrogance and all attitudes of haughtiness through reconciliation with the new status quo, and peaceableness with the Muslims; or launching a decisive overwhelming war with the aim of crushing down the military forces of Madinah. </p>
<p>It was apparent through the process of events that Quraish had opted for the second alternative. Loud cries were being heard everywhere in Makkah demanding immediate vengeance and quick retaliatory action. These movements on all levels constituted the direct preliminaries to the Battle of Uhud. </p>
<h3>The Battle of Uhud</h3>
<p>The defeat at Badr was an ignominy which the Quraishites' pride could not leave unavenged. Revenge was, therefore, the catchword all over Makkah. The Makkans even forbade lamenting over their murdered people, or ransoming their captives from the Badr Battle lest the Muslims should realize the grave degree of sadness and feeling of tragedy they were experiencing. </p>
<p>In the wake of Badr event, Quraish was in common consent and started fresh preparations to launch an overall war against the Muslims in order to restore their blemished prestige and wounded pride. The most enthusiastic polytheists desiring to go into a new battle were ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin Omaiyah, Abu Sufyan bin Harb, and ‘Abdullah bin Abi Rabi‘a. They were determined to crush the commonwealth of Islam once and for all. </p>
<p>Emissaries were sent to all the tribes to make common cause against the rising Faith. As a consequence of this, they managed to enlist the support of two well-known tribes, Kinana and Tihamah, besides some desert bedouins, Ahabish. It was also decided that the profits of the escaped caravan headed by Abu Sufyan, which amounted to 1000 camels and 50 thousand Dinars, should be devoted to providing equipment for the army. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Verily, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to hinder (men) from the path of Allâh, and so will they continue to spend it; but in the end, it will become an anguish for them. Then they will be overcome." [Al-Qur'an 8:36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also devised other ways of recruitment, including hiring poets to entice the tribes into fighting the Muslims. Safwan bin Omaiyah allured Abu ‘Azza, the poet, to work in this context in return for riches after the war or supporting his daughters if killed. Incidentally, this poet was a prisoner of war (in the context of the Badr events) in the hands of the Muslims and the Prophet [pbuh] was gracious enough to release him unransomed provided he would not engage in fighting against him. </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan nursed the most grudge against Muslims because he had lost most of his supplies in the As-Sawiq invasion, let alone the heavy economic losses that Quraish had sustained in the aftermath of the events that featured the platoon of Zaid bin Harithah. In light of these successive failures, Quraish precipitated and accelerated their preparations for a decisive battle with the Muslims. </p>
<p>At the turn of the year, everything was ready for the move. The Makkans also decided to take their women along with them for they might arouse them to fight manfully. Thus a contingent of three thousand pitched warriors, of whom seven hundred were mailed soldiers and two hundred well-mounted cavalry, with three thousand camels and fifteen women, marched towards Madinah. The general leader was Abu Sufyan bin Harb; the cavalry under the leadership of Khalid bin Al-Waleed assisted by ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, and Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar were entrusted with the flag. </p>
<p>Old deep-seated feelings of hatred, with heart-based grudge, enveloped the whole process foreshadowing bitter, bloody revenge-instigated fighting between the two parties. </p>
<h4>Meanwhile, Al-‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib was closely watching the military movements and preparations for war, and these were all included in an urgent message sent by him to the Prophet [pbuh], who received it while he was in Qubâ’ Mosque. Ubai bin Ka‘b read the letter to the Prophet [pbuh], who asked him to be reticent with respect to its serious contents. He hurried back to Madinah, convened a meeting with the Helpers and Emigrants, and conducted serious consultations regarding the measures to be taken.</h4>
<p>The whole of Madinah was put on alert, and all men were heavily armed even during prayer in anticipation of any emergency. A group of Helpers volunteered to guard the Prophet [pbuh] and kept a watchful eye all night at his door, among whom were Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, Usaid bin Hudair and Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah. Lest they should be taken by surprise, armed groups of the Madinese began to police the entrances and roads leading to the city. </p>
<p>Muslim platoons began to patrol the routes for any probable enemy raids. The Makkan army, on the other hand, continued the march along the usual western road. On reaching Al-Abwâ’, Hind bint ‘Utbah, Abu Sufyan’s wife, suggested that they dig up the grave of the Prophet [pbuh]’s mother, but the leaders of the army refused to do so for fear of the consequent results. The army then followed Wadi Al-‘Aqeeq and turned right to encamp themselves at a place called ‘Ainain near Uhud Mountain. That was on Friday, 6th Shawwal, 3 A.H.</p>
<h4>A Consultation Assembly for a Defence Plan</h4>
<p>The scouting party of Madinah conveyed the news of the Makkan army step by step. Then the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] held a head military consultation assembly to exchange views about the situation. He told them about a dream he had. He said:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By Allâh, I have dreamt of — I implore Allâh to be a dream of bounty — cows slaughtered and that there was a groove at the pointed top of my sword, and that I had inserted my hand into an immune armour." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interpretation of ‘the cows’ was that some of his men were killed, and ‘the groove at the pointed top of his sword’ was that a member of his House would be hurt. As for ‘the armour’, it was Madinah. Then he offered a suggestion that his Companions should not go out of Madinah and that they should encamp themselves within the city. He was of the opinion that the enemies should be left in the open to exhaust themselves, and thus the Muslims would not risk a battle. But if they thought of attacking Madinah, Muslim men would be ready to fight them at the mouths of lanes; whereas Muslim women would help from over the house roofs. </p>
<p>‘Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul — the head of the hypocrites — attended the meeting as a chief of Al-Khazraj and supported the Prophet [pbuh]’s plan. His agreement was not based on the righteousness of the plan but rather on personal benefit. He did not want to fight. On the contrary, he secretly aimed at being far away from the fight. However, it was Allâh’s Will that he should be disclosed and disgraced in public — for the first time. Allâh’s Will enabled the Muslims to recognize the reality of those snakes that were creeping within their garments and inside the sleeves of their clothes. Thanks to Allâh, they recognized them in one of the most critical times of their lives.</p>
<p>Some of the best honourable Companions, who had missed Al-Jihâd in Badr invasion, suggested that the Prophet [pbuh] should go out of Madinah and urged him to accept their point of view. One of them said: "O Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], for a long time we have been looking forward to this day; and we have implored Allâh to make such a day draw near. Thanks to Allâh, it is time to fight. So let us go out and fight our enemies lest they should think that we have lost heart and do not dare to fight them." </p>
<p>Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib, the paternal uncle of the Prophet [pbuh], who had already covered the ornaments of his sword with idolaters’ blood in the Badr Battle, was ahead of those enthusiasts who urged him to go out and meet the disbelievers. He said to the Prophet [pbuh]: "By Allâh, Who has sent the Book down unto you, I will not taste food till I fight them with my sword outside Madinah." </p>
<p>After weighing carefully the pros and cons of the issue, it was decided that the enemy should be resisted outside the city at Uhud. </p>
<h3>Dividing the Islamic Army into Phalanxes and Departure to the Battle-field</h3>
<p>Ascending the pulpit at the Friday congregational prayer, the Prophet [pbuh] urged the people in his sermon to fight courageously. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you remain steadfast," he said, "you will be helped by the Power of the All-Mighty." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he commanded his men to make ready for the battle. Most of them rejoiced greatly. He led the afternoon prayer with crowds of people. Then he entered his house accompanied by his two friends Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. They helped him dress and wear his headcloth. He armed himself and wore two armours, one over the other. He wore his sword and went out to meet people. </p>
<p>People were waiting for him impatiently. Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh and Usaid bin Hudair blamed people for pressing on the Prophet [pbuh]. They said: "You have forced the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to fight the enemy outside Madinah." Therefore, they were determined to leave the whole matter to the Prophet [pbuh] and blamed themselves for what they had already done. When the Prophet [pbuh] came out, they said: "O Messenger of Allâh, we should have not disagreed with you. So you are free to do what you desire. If you prefer to stay inside Madinah, we will stay with you." </p>
<p>Upon this, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] remarked: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It does not become a Prophet that once he has put on armour, he should take it off, until Allâh has decided between him and the enemy." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] divided his army into three battalions:
1. Al-Muhajireen battalion, under the command of Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair Al-‘Abdari.
2. Al-Ansari-Aws battalion, commanded by Usaid bin Hudair.
3. Al-Ansari-Khazraj battalion with Al-Hubab bin Al-Mundhir to lead it.  </p>
<p>The army consisted of a thousand fighters; a hundred of them armoured; another fifty horsemen. </p>
<p>He appointed Ibn Umm Maktum to lead the people in prayer in Madinah. Departure was announced, and the army moved northwards with the two Sa‘ds, who were armoured, running in front of the army. Upon passing along Al-Wada‘ mountain trail, he saw a well-armed battalion, which were detached from the main body of the army. The Prophet [pbuh] inquired who they were and he was told that they were Jews and were allies of Al-Khazraj. They told him that they wanted to contribute to the fight against the idolaters. </p>
<p>"Have they embraced Islam?" The Prophet [pbuh] asked. "No," they said. So he refused admitting them and said that he would not seek the assistance of disbelievers against the idolaters. </p>
<h3>Parading the Army</h3>
<p>As soon as he reached a location called Ash-Shaikhan, he paraded his army. He dismissed those whom he considered to be disabled or too young to stand the fight. Among them were ‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, Usama bin Zaid, Usaid bin Zaheer, Zaid bin Thabit, Zaid bin Arqam, ‘Araba bin Aws, ‘Amr bin Hazm, Abu Sa‘eed Al-Khudri, Zaid bin Haritha Al-Ansari, Sa‘d bin Habba and Al-Barâ’ bin ‘Azib. Sahih Al-Bukhari pointed out that he had shared in the fight that day. </p>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] allowed both Rafi‘ bin Khadaij and Samura bin Jundub to join the army — though they were too young. The former proved to be skillful at shooting arrows; the latter wrestled the former and beat him. The admission of Rafi‘ made Samura say: "I am stronger than him; I can overcome him." When the Prophet [pbuh] heard this saying, he ordered them to wrestle. They did. Samura won, so he was also admitted. </p>
<h3>Passing the Night between Uhud and Madinah</h3>
<p>As night fell upon them, they performed both the sunset and the evening prayers and spent the night there as well. Fifty people were chosen to guard the camp and go round it. Muhammad bin Maslama Al-Ansari, the hero of the brigade of Ka‘b bin Al-Ashraf, was in charge of the guards. Whereas Dhakwan bin ‘Abd Qais undertook the responsibility of guarding the Prophet [pbuh], in particular.</p>
<h4>The Rebellion of ‘Abdullah bin Ubai and his Followers</h4>
<p>At the end of the night and just before it was daybreak, the Prophet [pbuh] moved and when he got to Ash-Shawt, he observed the dawn prayer. There he was close enough to the enemy that they could see one another. It was there that ‘Abdullah bin Ubai — the hypocrite — rebelled against the Muslims. One-third of the army withdrew with him — that is to say, three hundred fighters. He said, "We do not know why we shall kill ourselves." </p>
<p>He claimed that his withdrawal was no more than showing protest against the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who had already refused his opinion and accepted that of the others. Undoubtedly that was not the real cause of his detachment. If it had been the refusal of his opinion — as the hypocrite claimed — there would have been no sense whatsoever for his joining the Prophetic army. If it had been so, he would have refused to go out with the army from the very beginning of the march. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the real purpose of this rebellion, withdrawal, and detachment — at this delicate and awkward position and time — was to produce bewilderment, confusion of mind, and disorder in the Muslims army who were within sight and hearing range of the enemy who were also looking forward to seeing more and more dissension on the side of the Muslims, like themselves. </p>
<p>They also aimed at breaking the high morale of the believers, which would accelerate — in their opinion — the breakdown and consequently the death of Muhammad, his faithful Companions, and Islam as a whole. The way would then be clear for the reclaim of presidency, which that hypocrite had lost with the advent of Islam into Madinah. </p>
<p>Short of Allâh’s Care, the hypocrite’s plot would have been successful. Banu Haritha of Al-Aws and Banu Salama of Al-Khazraj were partially impressed by the hypocrite’s behaviour. Both of them were overwhelmed by confusion and had almost started to withdraw, but Allâh’s Care saved them from that disgrace. About their incident, Allâh says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When two parties from among you were about to lose their heart, but Allâh was their Wali (Supporter and Protector). And in Allâh should the believers put their trust." [Al-Qur'an 3:122]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Abdullah bin Haram — the father of Jabir bin ‘Abdullah — attempted to stop their withdrawal. He reminded the hypocrites of their duty at this delicate and awkward condition, but in vain. He followed them, reproached them, and urged them to go back, saying: "Come and fight in the way of Allâh or at least be defenders." They said: "If we had known that you would really fight, we would not have gone back." </p>
<p>Having despaired of them, he addressed them saying: "May Allâh cast you away, you enemies of Allâh. Allâh will certainly suffice His Prophet." Allâh says about those hypocrites: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And that He might test the hypocrites, it was said to them: ‘Come, fight in the way of Allâh or (at least) defend yourselves.’ They said: ‘Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.’ They were that day, nearer to disbelief than to Faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. And Allâh has full knowledge of what they conceal." [Al-Qur'an 3:167] </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Remainder of the Islamic Army are on the Move to Uhud</h3>
<p>With the remainder of the fighters, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] moved towards the enemy. After the rebellion and withdrawal of the hypocrites, the number of soldiers was reduced to seven hundred only. The camp of idolaters was situated in such a place that the many roads leading to Uhud were almost blocked by them. </p>
<p>So the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to his men: "Which man of you can lead us to where the people (i.e. the idolaters) are, along a short track that does not pass by them?" Abu Khaithama said: "O Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], I am the man you need." Then he chose a short track that led to Uhud, passing by Harrah Bani Harithah and their farms, leaving the idolaters’ army westwards. </p>
<p>On their way, they passed by Ha’it (i.e. the field) of Marba‘ bin Qaizi, who was a blind hypocrite. When Marba‘ felt and realized that they were the Prophetic army, he started throwing earth at their faces, so they rushed to kill him, but the Prophet [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do not kill him. He is blind in heart and eyes." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] went along until he climbed down the hillock of Uhud at the slope of the valley. He camped there with his army facing Madinah while their backs were to the hills of Uhud mountain. So the enemy’s army stood as a barrier between the Muslims and Madinah. </p>
<h3>The Defence Plan</h3>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] mobilized his army. He arranged them into two rows to prepare them for the fight. He selected fifty skillful archers that formed a squad and made them under the command of ‘Abdullah bin Jubair bin An-Nu‘man Al-Ansari Al-Awsi Al-Badri. He issued his orders to them to stay where they were — on a mountain(side) at the south bank of Qanat Al-Wadi (i.e. a canal of the valley), southeast of the Muslims camp at about one hundred and fifty metres from the Islamic army. Later on, this mountain was called the Mountain of Archers. </p>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] clarified the mission of this squad in words he directed to them. He said to their leader: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Drive off the horses from us by means of arrows, lest they should attack us from behind (the rear). Whether we win the battle or lose it, stand steadily in your position and mind that we are not attacked from your side." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He added: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Defend our backs! If you see us slain, do not come to assist us; and if you see us gaining grounds, do not share us." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a version by Al-Bukhâri, the Prophet [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you see us snatched into pieces by birds, do not leave this position of yours till I send for you. And if you see that we have defeated the enemy and trodden on them, do not desert your position till I send for you." [Sahih Al-Bukhari, the Book of Jihad 1/426]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the assignment of this squad and locating it on the mountainside and the issuance of those strict military orders, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] blocked the only groove that might lead the idolaters stealthily to the rear of Muslim ranks and might even enable them to encircle them in an encompassment procedure. </p>
<p>The assignments of posts and responsibilities for the rest of the army were performed by the Prophet [pbuh] as follows: On the right wing, he appointed Al-Mundhir bin ‘Amr. On the left, he appointed Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam, and made Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad his assistant and supporter. Az-Zubair’s function was to stand fast in the face of Khalid bin Al-Waleed’s horsemen. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] selected the top and the most courageous group to be in the vanguard of the army. They were notable for their readiness, alertness, and bravery and estimated to be equal to thousands of men. </p>
<p>It was a wise and carefully-laid plan, which revealed the genius of military leadership that the Prophet [pbuh] possessed. No other leader could have drawn a more accurate or wise plan. Although he approached the site later than the enemy, he managed to occupy better positions. He made the rocky mountainside to function as a shield for the army’s rear and right flank. </p>
<p>He was able, by blocking the only vulnerable gap on the side, to provide additional maximum protection for the rear as well as the left wing. For fear of possible defeat, and to deter the Muslims from fleeing, in which case they would be easy prisoners in the hands of the enemy, he chose a high place for encampment. Moreover, a strategic site of this sort would surely inflict heavy losses on the polytheists if they thought of approaching or occupying his positions. </p>
<p>In a further step, he reduced the enemy to a narrow scope of choice when they were cornered for encampment in geographically low positions that would avail them nothing in terms of the benefits of any possible victory; at the same time, they would not be able to escape the pursuit of the Muslims in case victory sided with the latter. </p>
<p>To make up for the quantitative shortage in fighting personnel, he chose a picked body of fighters to stand at the front. The army of the Prophet [pbuh] was thus fully mobilized on Shawwal 7th, 3 A.H. </p>
<h3>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] implants the Spirit of Bravery among his Armed Forces</h3>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] forbade the Muslims to start the fight without having an order from him. He then wore two armours — a front armour and a back one. He urged his Companions to fight and spurred them to show stamina and steadfastness at the fight. He started to implant the spirit of boldness and bravery in them. To wage and inflame his Companions and in order to stand fast in the fight, he took a sharp sword, held it in his hand and called out unto his Companions and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who is ready to take this sword and give it its proper due?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many a man set out to take it. Some of them were ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam, and ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab. But it was granted to none. Abu Dujana, Sammak bin Kharsha, inquired: "O Messenger of Allâh, what is its price?" The Prophet [pbuh] said: "It is to strike the enemy’s faces with it till it was bent." So Abu Dujana said: "O Messenger of Allâh, I will take it for that price." and he was given the sword. </p>
<p>Abu Dujana was a man of courage who used to swagger at war. He had a red band which he wore round his head. Whenever he was head-banded, everybody knew that he was determined to fight to death. Therefore, as soon as Abu Dujana took the Prophet [pbuh]’s sword, he banded his head and started strutting amongst the fighters. Watching him doing that, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: "This is a sort of walking that Allâh detests except in such a situation." </p>
<h3>Recruitment of the Makkan Army</h3>
<p>The idolaters applied the rows system in the mobilization of their army. The general leadership of the army was entrusted to Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb, who would be in the central position of the army. Khalid bin Al-Waleed was on the right wing; whereas ‘Ikrima, the son of Abu Jahl was on the left. Safwan bin Omaiya was in charge of infantrymen. The archers were under the command of ‘Abdullah bin Abi Rabi‘a. </p>
<p>As for the standard, a squad of Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar were in charge of bearing it. Thus was the distribution of the posts of the army ever since ‘Abd Munaf had already assigned them. This assignment had been inherited from Qusai bin Kilab — as we have previously alluded to in an early phase of this book. No one had the right to compete with them regarding it. It was consistent with their traditions that they had inherited from their ancestors. </p>
<p>Abu Sufyan, the general leader, reminded his men — the standard bearers — of what had happened to Quraish on Badr Day (i.e. battle) when their standard bearer, An-Nadr bin Al-Harith, was captured. In an attempt to wage their anger and enmity towards the Muslims, he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar! You have been assigned bearers of our standard, and you know that the standard is the first thing that the enemy attacks. Should it fall, we fall down too. Therefore, I say either you guarantee its safety or leave it for us, and we will certainly suffice you that task." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abu Sufyan’s attempt seemed to be fruitful. For his speech made Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar so extremely angry that they threatened him and almost attacked him for that. Addressing him, they said: "You want us to deliver you the custodianship of the standard? Tomorrow, when we fight them, you will witness our deeds." </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, they fought bravely and stood fast in defence of the standard till they were all killed. </p>
<h3>Political Manoeuvres of Quraish</h3>
<p>A little time before the breakout of the battle, Quraish made some endeavours to sow the seeds of discord and dispute among the Muslims. First, Abu Sufyan sent to the Helpers a message saying: "Leave us alone to fight our cousins and do not interfere. If you stand aside, we will not fight you; for fighting you is not a target of ours." But that attempt proved to be fruitless. What could such a wicked scheme do to those whose Faith was as solid and firm as mountains?! The Helpers' reply was undoubtedly disappointing and contrary to Abu Sufyan’s expectations. </p>
<p>The zero hour was due. The two parties drew nearer. Undaunted by the first failure, Quraish made another attempt, for the same purport but now with the assistance of a traitor called Abu ‘Amir Al-Fasiq, whose name was ‘Abd ‘Amr bin Saifi. He was called a monk, but the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] nicknamed him Al-Fâsiq (i.e. perverted transgressor; dissolute). </p>
<p>As he was the head of Aws in Al-Jahiliya, he could not tolerate Islam when it came. He announced his enmity to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] in public. He left Madinah for the Quraishites in Makkah to rally them against the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and to urge them to start the fight against him. He claimed that he was obeyed and esteemed by his people and that as soon as they saw him come, they would join him immediately. </p>
<p>So he was the first one among the mob and slaves of Quraish to show resistance. He called out unto his people, recognized them, and said: "O kinfolk of Aws! I am Abu ‘Amir." Their reply was "No eyes of anybody shall be consoled by viewing you, O Fâsiq." Hearing them say so, he said: "My people must have been afflicted by an evil after my departure." Therefore, when the fight broke out, he fought them fiercely and pelted his people with stones. </p>
<p>That was how the second attempt of Quraish to sow the seeds of discord among people of Faith. This, however, revealed the great terror of the Quraishites cast in their hearts in spite of their supremacy in number and equipment. </p>
<h3>The Effort of Quraishi-Women at Waging the Zeal of Men</h3>
<p>Quraishi women participated in the battle led by the wife of Abu Sufyan, Hind bint ‘Utbah. They wandered among the rows of the idolaters, tapped on tambourines, encouraged men to fight, and inflamed the emotions of heroes, lancers, swordsmen, and brave fighters. At one time, they addressed the standard bearers: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar!<br />
O home defenders,<br />
Strike with your sharp swords …" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And at another time, they would wage people’s zeal by singing: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you fight (bravely), we will embrace<br />
and unfold mats to welcome you.<br />
But if you flee from the battlefield,<br />
we leave you,<br />
Desert you, and no more love you." </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Combat</h3>
<p>The two parties approached and grew very close to each other. The phases of the fight started. The first combatant was the standard-bearer, Talha bin Abi Talha Al-‘Abdari, who was the most distinguished idolater. He was one of the bravest men of Quraish fighters. Muslims nicknamed him ‘the ram of the battalion.’ He came forth riding a camel and challenged the Muslims to a single combat. People refrained from fighting him due to his bravery; but Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam advanced for the fight. He did not give the ‘Ram’ any chance to fight but fell on him like a lion on his camel’s back, pulled him down to the ground, and slaughtered him with his sword. </p>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who was watching that wonderful incident exclaimed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allâhu Akbar" - "Allâh is the Greatest" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the Muslims exclaimed "Allâhu Akbar" too. He praised Az-Zubair when he said: "Every Prophet has a disciple and Az-Zubair is a disciple of mine." </p>
<p>Soon the general engagement ensued and the fight of the two parties grew fierce everywhere on the battlefield. The strain of the fight was centred around the carriers of the standard. After the death of their leader Talha bin Abi Talha, Banu ‘Abd Ad-Dar alternated the mission successively. Talha’s brother, ‘Uthman, ran forward and seized the standard which lay by the lifeless body of his brother, chanting: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The standard-bearer has the right to dye its shaft in blood, till it be beaten in his hand." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib attacked and dealt him a blow that cut his arm and shoulder and went down to his navel to uncover his lung. The standard was raised up again by Abu Sa‘d bin Abi Talha, but Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas shot him with a deadly arrow that hit him at his throat and made his tongue hang out breathing his last. </p>
<p>In another version, it was narrated that Abu Sa‘d lifted the standard up and challenged the Muslims to fight him. ‘Ali bin Abi Talib went forth. They exchanged two blows. Then ‘Ali gave him a terminal blow that finished him off. Musafi‘ bin Talha bin Abi Talha then hoisted the standard, but was soon shot with an arrow by ‘Asim bin Thabit bin Abi Al-Aqlah. His brother Kilab bin Talha bin Abi Talha followed him, picked the banner and lifted it up; but Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam attacked him and managed to kill him. </p>
<p>Their brother Al-Jallas bin Talha bin Abi Talha lifted the banner up but Talha bin ‘Ubaidu-Allâh stabbed him to death. They also said that it was ‘Asim bin Thabit who managed to deal a terminal blow to him. All those six people killed round and in defence of the standard belonged to one house, the house of Abi Talha, ‘Abdullah bin ‘Uthman bin ‘Abd Ad-Dar. </p>
<p>Another man from Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar, called Artat bin Sharhabeel, carried the standard but he also was killed by ‘Ali bin Abi Talib. Others said it was Hamzah who killed him, not ‘Ali. Then it was Shuraih bin Qariz who was killed by Quzman — he was a hypocrite who fought for prestige only, not in defence of Islam. Abu Zaid ‘Amr bin ‘Abd Munaf Al-‘Abdari lifted the standard up but he was killed by Quzman too. A son of Sharhabeel bin Hashim Al-‘Abdari hoisted it again and was also killed by Quzman. </p>
<p>So we see that ten fighters of Bani ‘Abd Ad-Dar — the standard bearers — were annihilated. Seeing that none of ‘Abd Ad-Dars survived to carry the standard, a slave of theirs — called Sawab — came to raise it. The slave showed more admirable sorts of bravery and steadfastness than his former masters. Sawab, the slave went on fighting till his hand was cut off. So he knelt down and embraced the banner, leant it against his chest and neck lest it should fall down to the ground. </p>
<p>He remained fighting steadily and steadfastly till he was killed. In the meanwhile, he did not stop saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Allâh, have I been excused?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the death of the slave Sawab, the standard fell down to the ground, and remained there as there was no one to carry it. </p>
<p>Whilst the brunt of the battle centred around the standard, bitter fighting was going on everywhere on the battlefield. The spirit of Faith overwhelmed the Muslims’ ranks; so they rushed among the idolaters as if they had been an outbreak of a destructive flood that overflowed and knocked down all dams and barriers standing in its way. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I seek death, I seek death." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was their announced motto on Uhud Day. Abu Dujana, recognized by the red band worn round his head, came forth, fighting with the sword of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. He was determined to pay its price at all costs. He killed all the idolaters that stood in his way, splitting and dispersing their ranks. </p>
<p>Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam said: "I felt angry and discouraged when the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] refused to give me the sword but granted it to Abu Dujana. I said to myself: ‘I am his paternal cousin — the cousin of his aunt Safiya — a Quraishite, besides, I was the first who demanded it and yet he favoured him to me. By Allâh, I will watch how he will use it.’ So I followed him; I saw him take out his red band and wear it round his head. Seeing him like that, the Helpers said, ‘Abu Dujana has worn the band of death.’ </p>
<p>Then he set out saying loudly:<br />
"I am the one whom my intimate friend made a covenant with, when we were under the palm-trees on the mountain side.<br />
The covenant that we made was that I should not fight at the rear.<br />
But fight at the front heroically with the sword of Allâh and His Messenger."  </p>
<p>No one stood in the way of Abu Dujana but was killed. There was a man among the idolaters whose only target was to finish off the wounded Muslims. During the fight, Abu Dujana drew near that man; so I implored Allâh that they might engage in combat. They in fact did and exchanged two sword-strokes. The idolater struck Abu Dujana, but he escaped it, and it pierced into his leather shield. The idolater’s sword now stuck to it; Abu Dujana struck him with the sword and killed him. </p>
<p>Into the thick of the battle, he rushed to kill a person who was inciting the enemy to fight the Muslims. Upon this, the person shrieked and lo! it was a woman. Abu Dujana spared her, saying: "I respect the Prophet [pbuh]’s sword too much to use it on a woman." The woman was Hind bint ‘Utbah." </p>
<p>Describing the same incident, Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam said: "I saw Abu Dujana raising a sword over the parting part of Hind bint ‘Utba’s head then he moved it off. I said to myself: ‘Allâh and His Messenger know best.’ (i.e. know why he acted like that)."  </p>
<p>Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib displayed wonderful feats of gallantry against the overwhelming odds which stood unparalleled and created consternation and confusion in the disbelieving hosts. Heroes dispersed off his way as if they had been tree-leaves blown away by strong wind. </p>
<p>In addition to his effective contribution to the annihilation of the idolaters who stood in defence of the standard, he was even of much greater effect at fighting against men of bravery and distinguished horsemen. It was Allâh’s Will that he be murdered when he was at the top. He was not killed in a face-to-face fight on the battlefield — in the normal way by which heroes die — but rather assassinated in the dead-dark as was the custom of killing generous and noble men that were impossible to kill in an honourable fight.</p>
<h3>Assassination of Asadullâh (the Lion of Allâh) Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib</h3>
<p>Hamzah’s assassin, Wahshi bin Harb, described how he killed Hamzah. He said: "I was a slave working to Jubair bin Mut‘im, whose paternal uncle Tu‘aimah bin ‘Adi was injured at Badr Battle. So when Quraish marched to Uhud, Jubair said to me: ‘If you kill Hamzah, the uncle of Muhammad, stealthily you shall be manumitted.’ </p>
<p>So I marched with the people to Uhud." He used to describe himself as, "I am a picaro good at spearing." "So when the two parties fought, I set out seeking Hamzah. I saw him amidst people fighting. He was like a white and black striped camel, striking severely with his sword and no one could stand on his way. By Allâh! </p>
<p>When I was getting ready and trying to seize the fit opportunity to spear him, hiding sometimes behind a tree or a rock hoping that he might draw nearer and be within range — at that moment, I caught sight of Siba‘ bin ‘Abd Al-‘Uzza going closer towards him. When Hamzah observed him, he said: 'Come on! O son of the ‘clitoris-cutter.’ — for his mother used to be a circumciser. Then he struck one strong stroke that could hardly miss his head." </p>
<p>Wahshi said: "Then I balanced my spear and shook it till I was content with it, then I speared him and it went down into his stomach and issued out between his legs. He attempted moving towards me but he was overcome by his wound. I left him there with the spear in his entrails till he died. Then I came to him, pulled out my spear and returned to the encampment place. I stayed there and did not go out, for he was the only one I sought. I only killed him to free myself. So as soon as I got back to Makkah, I became a free man." </p>
<h3>Bringing the Situation under Control</h3>
<p>Although the death of Asad (Lion) of Allâh and His Messenger — Hamzah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib — was a great loss, the Muslims maintained full control over the whole situation on the battlefield. On that day, Abu Bakr, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, Az-Zubair bin Al-‘Awwam, Mus‘ab bin ‘Umair, Talha bin ‘Ubaidullâh, ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh, Sa‘d bin Ar-Rabî‘, and Anas bin An-Nadr, and others — all of them fought so fiercely, effectively, and efficiently that they broke the strong will of the idolaters and scattered them.</p>
<h3>From His Wife’s Lap to Sword-fights and Sorrows</h3>
<p>One of the brave adventurers of that day was Hanzala Al-Ghaseel — he was Hanzala bin Abu ‘Amir. Abu ‘Amir was the very monk that was nicknamed ‘Al-Fâsiq’ (i.e. the dissolute, evildoer). He is the very one that we have recently mentioned. Hanzala, who was newly married, left his wife’s bed for Al-Jihâd (Fight in the cause of Allâh). He set out the moment he heard of the call to Al-Jihâd. </p>
<p>When he faced the idolaters on the battlefield, he made his way through their ranks until he reached their leader Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb and had almost killed him, if he had not been ordained to be a martyr. For at that moment, he was seen by Shaddad bin Al-Aswad who struck him to death. </p>
<h3>The Contribution of the Archers Squad to the Battle</h3>
<p>The archers squad whom the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] located on the Archers Mountain, had the upper hand in administering the war activities to go in favour of the Muslim army. The Makkan horsemen — commanded by Khalid bin Al-Waleed, supported by Abu ‘Amir Al-Fâsiq — had for three times attacked the left wing of the Muslim army with the aim of crushing it and then infiltrating into the rear to create a sort of confusion and disorder in the ranks of the Muslims and subsequently inflict heavy defeat on them. </p>
<p>But thanks to the dexterity and great efforts of the archers, the three assaults were thwarted.</p>
<p>War activities went on fiercely with the Muslims in full command of the whole military developments until the idolaters finally staggered and retreated, leaving all motives of alleged pride and affected dignity in oblivion, and their standard trodden by the feet of the fighters with none ever courageous enough to approach it. </p>
<p>Ibn Ishaq said: "Then Allâh sent down His Help unto the Muslims and verified His Promise to them. They chased the idolaters and evacuated them from their camp. No doubt it was a certain defeat." </p>
<p>In a version by ‘Abdullah bin Az-Zubair that his father had said: "By Allâh, I was watching the servants of Hind bint ‘Utbah and her women friends fleeing with their garments gathered up. No one was there to prevent us from capturing them." </p>
<p>In another version by Al-Barâ’ bin ‘Azib — mentioned in Sahih Al-Bukhâri — he said: "When we fought them, they fled, and their women could be seen fleeing in the mountains with their anklets and legs revealed." The Muslims pursued the enemies, putting them to the sword and collecting the spoils.</p>
<h3>The Archers’ Fatal Mistake</h3>
<p>While the small army of Islam were recording the second absolute and clear victory over the Makkans — which was no less in splendour and glory than the first one at Badr — the majority of the archers on the mountainside committed a fatal mistake that turned the whole situation upside down and constituted a source of heavy losses among the Muslims. It has almost brought about the murder of the Prophet [pbuh], and left a very bad impression on the fame and dignity they deservedly earned at the Badr Battle. </p>
<p>We have already spoken about the positive orders given to the archers to hold on to their position, whatever the course of the main engagement. In spite of those strict orders, and their leader’s — ‘Abdullah bin Jubair — warning, forty archers deserted their posts, enticed by the too soon roar of victory as well as worldly avarice for the spoils of war. The others, however, nine in number, and ‘Abdullah, their leader, decided to abide by the Prophet [pbuh]’s order and stay where they were until they were given leave or killed to the last. </p>
<p>Consequently, the cleft was left inadequately defended. The shrewd Khalid bin Al-Waleed seized this golden opportunity to turn swiftly round to the rear of the Muslim army and encompass them. Exterminating Ibn Jubair and his group, they fell promptly upon the rear of the Muslims, and his horsemen uttered a shout that signalled the new military developments. The polytheists returned once again to counterattack the Muslims. An idolist woman — called ‘Umra bint ‘Alqama Al-Harithiyah — rushed to the lying-on-earth standard, picked it up and hoisted it. The idolaters gathered together around the standard and called out unto one another till they encircled the Muslims and stood fast to fight again. </p>
<p>The Muslims consequently got entrapped between two millstones. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was then among a small group of fighters — nine in number at the rear of the army, watching the engagement and braving the Muslim fighters. Khalid and his men took him by utter surprise, and obliged him to follow either of two options: 
1. To flee for his life and abandon his army to its doomed end, or 
2. To take action at the risk of his life, rally the ranks of the Muslims again, and work their way through the hills of Uhud towards the encompassed army.</p><p><a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_6">Previous</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/index.html">Index</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_8">Next</a></p></body>
