<p>In the context surrounding the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) diplomatic and military strategies during the 7th year after Hijra (A.H.), it is essential to comprehend several key events. Notably, this period saw the Compensatory ‘Umrah, where the Muslims, led by the Prophet, returned to the sacred city of Makkah under the terms of the Treaty of Al-Hudaibiyah. This pilgrimage, undertaken by 2000 Muslims besides women and children, was marked by cautious optimism and defensive preparedness, as they entered Makkah ready to defend themselves but hoping for peace. The Quraysh, while wary, allowed the rites to proceed, thus upholding the treaty's stipulations for three days. This event was significant for solidifying the presence and resolve of the Muslim community in the region by showcasing their faith and unity.</p>
<p>During the same period, numerous military operations took place aimed at stabilizing the political landscape in favor of Muslims. Various skirmishes occurred against adversarial Arabian tribes still resisting Islamic influence, including expeditions led by prominent companions like Abu Hadrad, Ibn Abi Al-‘Awja’, and Ghalib bin ‘Abdullah. These expeditions often faced fierce resistance, yet they were crucial in expanding Islamic influence and inviting tribes to embrace Islam. Despite mixed successes, the series of engagements underlined the relentless push by the Prophet to secure a peaceful environment conducive to the spread of Islam.</p>
<p>Moreover, one of the pivotal battles that reflected the strategic prowess and resilience of the Muslim community was the Battle of Mu’tah. Occurring in Jumada Al-Ula, 8 A.H., it was the largest confrontation during the Prophet's lifetime against the Byzantine forces and their Arab allies. Though severely outnumbered, the Muslim army of 3000 men, displaying unmatched courage and dedication under successive command changes, showcased their valor. Zaid bin Haritha, Ja‘far bin Abi Talib, and ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha demonstrated ultimate sacrifice, passing the leadership to Khalid bin Al-Waleed, whose strategic prowess led to an organized withdrawal. This battle, despite not leading to an immediate military victory, proved significant in establishing the strength and divine backing of the Muslims, bolstering their reputation and eventually leading to a greater acceptance of Islam by surrounding tribes.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<p>Some suggested that they should write a letter to the Prophet [pbuh] seeking his advice. ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha was opposed to them being reluctant and addressed the Muslims saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I swear by Allâh that this very object which you hold in abhorrence is the very one you have set out seeking, martyrdom. In our fight we don’t count on number of soldiers or equipment but rather on the Faith that Allâh has honoured us with. Dart to win either of the two, victory or martyrdom."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the light of these words, they moved to engage with the enemy in Masharif, a town of Al-Balqa’, and then changed direction towards Mu’tah where they encamped. The right flank was led by Qutba bin Qatadah Al-‘Udhari, and the left by ‘Ubadah bin Malik Al-Ansari. Bitter fighting started between the two parties, three thousand Muslims against an enemy fiftyfold as large.</p>
<p>Zaid bin Haritha, the closest to the Messenger’s heart, assumed leadership and began to fight tenaciously and in matchless spirit of bravery until he fell, fatally stabbed. Ja‘far bin Abi Talib then took the banner and did a miraculous job. In the thick of the battle, he dismounted, hamstrung his horse, and resumed fighting until his right hand was cut off. He seized the banner with his left hand until this too was gone. He then clasped the banner with both arms until a Byzantine soldier struck and cut him into two parts. He was posthumously called "the flying Ja‘far" or "Ja‘far with two wings" because Allâh has awarded him two wings to fly wherever he desired there in the eternal Garden. Al-Bukhari reported fifty stabs in his body, none of them in the back. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/611]</p>
<p>‘Abdullah bin Rawaha then proceeded to hold up the banner and fight bravely on his horseback while reciting enthusiastic verses until he too was killed. Thereupon a man, from Bani ‘Ajlan, called Thabit bin Al-Arqam took the banner and called upon the Muslims to choose a leader. The honour was unanimously granted to Khalid bin Al-Waleed, a skilled brave fighter and an outstanding strategist. It was reported by Al-Bukhari that he used nine swords that broke while he was relentlessly and courageously fighting the enemies of Islam. He, however, realizing the grave situation the Muslims were in, began to follow a different course of encounter, revealing the super strategy-maker that Khalid was rightly called. </p>
<p>He reshuffled the right and left flanks of the Muslim army and introduced forward a division from the rear in order to cast fear into the hearts of the Byzantine by deluding them that fresh reinforcements had arrived. The Muslims engaged with the enemies in sporadic skirmishes but gradually and judiciously retreated in a fully organized and well-planned withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Byzantines, seeing this new strategy, believed that they were being entrapped and drawn in the heart of the desert. They stopped the pursuit, and consequently, the Muslims managed to retreat back to Madinah with the slightest losses. [Fath-Al-Bari 7/513, 514; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/156]</p>
<p>The Muslims sustained twelve martyrs, whereas the number of casualties among the Byzantines was unknown although the details of the battle point clearly to a large number. Even though the battle did not satisfy the Muslims’ objective, namely avenging Al-Harith’s murder, it resulted in a far-ranging impact and attached to the Muslims a great reputation in the battlefields. The Byzantine Empire, at that time, was a power to be reckoned with, and mere thinking of antagonizing it used to mean self-annihilation, let alone a three-thousand-soldier army going into a fight against 200,000 soldiers far better equipped and lavishly furnished with all luxurious conveniences. The battle was a real miracle proving that the Muslims were something exceptional not then familiar. Moreover, it gave evidence that Allâh backed them and their Prophet, Muhammad, was really Allâh’s Messenger.</p>
<p>In the light of these new strategic changes, the archenemies among the desert Bedouins began to reconcile themselves with the new uprising faith and several recalcitrant tribes like Banu Saleem, Ashja‘, Ghatfan, Dhubyan, Fazarah and others came to profess Islam out of their own free will. </p>
<p>The Mu’tah Battle, after all, constituted the forerunner of the blood encounter to take place with the Byzantines subsequently. It pointed markedly to a new epoch of the Islamic conquest of the Byzantine Empire and other remote countries, to follow at a later stage.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Dhat As-Salasil Campaign</h1>
<p>Dhat As-Salasil is a spot situated ten days’ walk north of Madinah. The Muslims are said to have encamped in a place with a well of water called Salsal, hence the terminology Dhat As-Salasil. In view of the alliance between the Arabian tribes on the borders of Syria and the Byzantines, the Prophet [pbuh] deemed it of top urgency to carry out a wisely-planned manoeuvre that might bring about a state of rapport with those Bedouins, and would at the same time detach them from the Byzantines. For the implementation of this plan, he chose ‘Amr bin Al-‘As, whose paternal grandmother came from Bali, a tribe dwelling in that area. This motive in mind, combined with provocative military movements, by Bani Quda‘a, precipitated this preemptive strike which started in Jumada Ath-Thaniya, 8 A.H.</p>
<p>‘Amr bin Al-‘As was awarded a white flag with a black banner to go with it. He set out at the head of 300 Emigrants and Helpers assisted by a cavalry of 30 men, and was recommended to seek help from Bali, ‘Udhra and Balqain tribes. He used to march at night and lurk during the day. On approaching the enemy lines and realizing the large buildup of men, he sent for reinforcements from Madinah, and these arrived on the spot headed by Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah leading further 200 men as well as other platoons including Abu Bakr and ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab. All of them were given strict orders to cooperate, work in harmony and never leave any area for disagreement.</p>
<p>At noon, Abu ‘Ubaidah wanted to lead the Muslims in prayer, but ‘Amr objected on the grounds that the former came only to assist, and leadership in prayer was given to ‘Amr. </p>
<p>The Muslim army reached the habitations of Quda‘a and penetrated deep into their land, destroyed the enemies and obliged the others to flee for their lives in different directions. </p>
<p>At the conclusion of the military operations, a courier was despatched to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to brief him on the developments of events and the ultimate victory achieved.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Khadrah Campaign</h1>
<p>In Sha‘ban month 8 A.H., news reached the Prophet [pbuh] of amassing troops by Bani Ghatfan, still outside the domain of Islam. He urgently summoned Abu Qatadah and sent him at the head of fifteen men to discipline those outlaws. </p>
<p>It took fifteen days to teach them an unforgettable lesson. Some were killed, others captured and all their property confiscated. [Rahmat-ul-lil'alameen 2/233; Talqeeh Fuhoom Ahl Al-Athar p.33]</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Conquest of Makkah</h1>
<p>Ibn Al-Qaiyim described the conquest of Makkah as the greatest one by which Allâh honoured His religion, Messenger, soldiers and honest party. He thereby rescued the Sacred House, whose guidance all people seek. It was the greatest propitious event in heaven and on earth. It was the most significant prelude to a new era that was to witness the great march of Islamization and the entry of people into the fold of Islam in huge hosts. It provided an ever shining face and a most glowing source of inspiration to the whole earth. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/160]</p>
<h2>Pre-Conquest Events</h2>
<p>According to the terms of the Treaty of Hudaibiyah, the Arab tribes were given the option to join either of the parties, the Muslims or Quraish, with which they desired to enter into treaty alliance. Should any of these tribes suffer aggression, then the party to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, Banu Bakr joined Quraish, and Khuza‘ah joined the Prophet [pbuh]. They thus lived in peace for some time, but ulterior motives stretching back to the pre-Islamic period ignited by unabated fire of revenge triggered fresh hostilities. </p>
<p>Banu Bakr, without caring a bit for the provisions of the treaty, attacked Banu Khuza‘ah in a place called Al-Wateer in Sha‘ban, 8 A.H. Quraish helped Banu Bakr with men and arms taking advantage of the dark night. Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza‘ah sought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary to all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chasing them in the sanctified area — where no blood should be shed — massacred his adversaries.</p>
<p>When the aggrieved party sought justice from their Muslim allies, the Prophet [pbuh], as their leader, demanded an immediate redress for not only violating the treaty but also slaying men allied to him in the sanctified area. Three demands were made, the acceptance of any one of them was imperative: </p>
<p>a. to pay blood money for the victims of Khuza‘ah,<br />
b. to terminate their alliance with Banu Bakr; or<br />
c. to consider the truce to have been nullified.  </p>
<p>This behaviour on the part of Quraish was clearly a breach of the treaty of Al-Hudaibiyah and was obviously an act of hostility against the allies of the Muslims, i.e. Banu Khuza‘ah. Quraish immediately realized the grave situation and feared the horrible consequences looming on the horizon. They immediately called for an emergency meeting and decided to delegate their chief Abu Sufyan to Madinah for a renewal of the truce. </p>
<p>He directly headed for the house of his daughter Umm Habiba (the Prophet’s wife). But as he went to sit on the Messenger’s carpet, she folded it up. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My daughter," said he, "I hardly knew if you think the carpet is too good for me or that I am too good for the carpet." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She replied, "It is the Messenger of Allâh’s carpet, and you are an unclean polytheist." </p>
<p>Being disgusted at the curt reply of his daughter, Abu Sufyan stepped out of her room and went to see the Prophet [pbuh], but the latter was well aware of his tricks and did not hold him any assurance. He then approached Abu Bakr, but the latter too declined to interfere. He contacted ‘Umar to intercede but this great Companion made a point-blank refusal. At last, he saw ‘Ali bin Abi Talib and began begging him in the most humble words, cunningly alluding to the prospects of mastery over all the Arabs if he were to intercede for the renewal of the treaty. </p>
<p>‘Ali also briefly regretted his inability to do anything for him. Abu Sufyan turned his steps back to Makkah in a state of bitter disappointment and utter horror. There he submitted a report of his meeting with his daughter, Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, and ‘Ali’s reaction and the meaningful silence of the Prophet. The Makkans were dismayed but did not expect imminent danger.  </p>
<h2>Preparations for the Attack on Makkah, and the Prophet’s Attempt at Imposing a News Black-out</h2>
<p>On the authority of At-Tabari, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] asked ‘Aishah [R], his spouse three days prior to receiving news relating to the breaching of covenant, to make preparations peculiar to marching out for war. Abu Bakr, meanwhile, came in and asked ‘Aishah [R] what the matter was, showing surprise at the preparations being made as it was not, as he said, the usual time for war. She replied that she had no idea. On the morning of the third day ‘Amr bin Sâlim Al-Khuza‘i arrived in the company of forty horsemen to brief the Prophet [pbuh] on the plight of his people and seeking the Muslims’ help for retaliation. </p>
<p>People of Madinah then got to know that Quraish had breached the covenant. Budail followed ‘Amr, and then Abu Sufyan and the news was unequivocally confirmed. </p>
<p>With view of securing a complete news black-out concerning his military intentions, the Prophet [pbuh] despatched an eight-men platoon under the leadership of Qatadah bin Rab‘i in the direction of Edam, a short distance from Madinah, in Ramadan 8 A.H., in order to divert the attention of people and screen off the main target with which he was preoccupied. </p>
<p>There was so much dread and fear everywhere that Hatib, one of the most trusted followers of the Prophet [pbuh] secretly despatched a female messenger with a letter to Makkah containing intimation of the intended attack. The Prophet [pbuh] received news from the heaven of Hatib’s action and sent ‘Ali and Al-Miqdad with instructions to go after her. They overtook the messenger, and after a long search discovered the letter carefully hidden in her locks. </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] summoned Hatib and asked him what had induced him to this act. He replied,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]! I have no affinity of blood with Quraish; there is only a kind of friendly relationship between them and myself. My family is at Makkah and there is no one to look after it or to offer protection to it. My position stands in striking contrast to that of the refugees whose families are secure due to their blood ties with Quraish. I felt that since I am not related to them, I should, for the safety of my children, earn their gratitude by doing good to them. I swear by Allâh that I have not done this act as an apostate, forsaking Islam. I was prompted only by the considerations I have just explained."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Umar wanted to cut his head off as a hypocrite, but the Prophet [pbuh] accepted his excuse and granted him pardon, then addressed ‘Umar saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hatib is one of those who fought in the battle of Badr. How do you know that he is a hypocrite? Allâh is likely to look favourably on those who participated in that battle. Turning then, to Hatib, he said: "Do as you please, for I have forgiven you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After making full preparation, the Prophet [pbuh] proceeded to Makkah at the head of ten thousand soldiers on the 10th of Ramadan, 8 A.H. He mandated Abu Ruhm Al-Ghifari to dispose of the affairs of Madinah during his absence. When they reached Al-Juhfa, Al-‘Abbas bin ‘Abdul Muttalib and his family came to join the Prophet [pbuh]. </p>
<p>At Al-Abwa’, the Muslims came across Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith and ‘Abdullah bin Omaiyah, the Prophet’s cousins, but, on account of the harm they had inflicted, and their satiric language, on the believers, they were not welcomed. ‘Ali addressed Abu Sufyan to go and beseech the Prophet [pbuh] for pardon and confess his ill-behaviour in a manner similar to that of Yusuf’s (the Prophet Joseph) brothers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They said: ‘By Allâh! Indeed Allâh has preferred you above us, and we certainly have been sinners.’" [Al-Qur'an 12:91] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abu Sufyan observed ‘Ali’s counsel, to which the Prophet quoted Allâh’s Words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He said: ‘No reproach on you this day, may Allâh forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!’" [Al-Qur'an 12:92] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abu Sufyan recited some verses paying a generous tribute to the Prophet [pbuh] and professing Islam as his only religion. </p>
<p>The Muslims then marched on in a state of fasting until they reached a place called Al-Qadeed where water was available. There they broke fast [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/613] and resumed their movement towards Mar Az-Zahran. The Quraishites were quite unaware of the development of affairs, but the Prophet [pbuh] did not like to take them by surprise. He, therefore, ordered his men to kindle fire on all sides for cooking purposes. The idea behind this was that Quraish should be afforded full opportunity to assess the situation in which they were pitchforked correctly and should not endanger their lives by leaping blindly in the battlefield. </p>
<p>‘Umar bin Al-Khattab was entrusted with the guard duty. In the meanwhile, Abu Sufyan along with Hakim bin Hizam and Budail bin Warqua’, two terrible polytheists, went out to reconnoiter. Before they got near the camp, they met ‘Abbas, the Prophet’s uncle. He apprised Abu Sufyan of the situation and advised him to accept Islam and persuade his people to surrender before Muhammad [pbuh]; otherwise, his head would be struck off. </p>
<p>Under the prevailing compelling circumstances, Abu Sufyan went in the company of ‘Abbas seeking the Prophet’s [pbuh] audience. The Muslims were furious to see Abu Sufyan and wanted to kill him on the spot. But the two men managed, not without difficulties, to see the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] who advised that they see him the following day. </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] addressed Abu Sufyan saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Woe to you! Isn’t it time for you to bear witness to the Oneness of Allâh and Prophethood of Muhammad?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the archenemy of Islam began to beseech the Prophet [pbuh] in the most earnest words that testify to the Prophet’s generosity and mild temper begging for pardon and forgiveness, and professing wholeheartedly the new faith. </p>
<p>On request by ‘Abbas, the Prophet [pbuh], in the context of the general amnesty he proclaimed, gave Abu Sufyan, who had a liking for bragging, a special privilege, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He who takes refuge in Abu Sufyan’s house is safe; whosoever confines himself to his house, the inmates thereof shall be in safety, and he who enters the Sacred Mosque is safe." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the morning of Tuesday, 17th Ramadan, 8 A.H., the Prophet [pbuh] left Mar Az-Zahran. He ordered Al-‘Abbas to detain Abu Sufyan at a commanding gorge that could afford a full view of the Muslim army parading on its way towards Makkah, and hence give him the chance to see the great and powerful soldiers of Allâh. </p>
<p>The different tribes successively passed with their banners flown up, until at last the battalion of the Emigrants and Helpers with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head heavily armed marched by. Abu Sufyan began to wonder who those people were, to which Al-‘Abbas told him that they were Muhammad [pbuh] and his Companions. Abu Sufyan said that no army however powerful could resist those people and addressing Al-‘Abbas, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I swear by Allâh that the sovereignty of your brother’s son has become too powerful to withstand."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-‘Abbas answered, "It is rather the power of Prophethood," to which the former agreed. </p>
<p>Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah carried the flag of the Helpers. When he passed by Abu Sufyan, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Today will witness the great fight, you cannot seek sanctuary at Al-Ka‘bah. Today will witness the humiliation of Quraish."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abu Sufyan complained about this to the Prophet [pbuh] who got angry and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nay, today Al-Ka‘bah will be sanctified, and Quraish honored," </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and quickly ordered that Sa‘d should be stripped off the flag, and that it should be entrusted to his son Qais, in another version, to Az-Zubair. </p>
<p>Al-‘Abbas urged Abu Sufyan to hasten into Makkah and warn the Quraishites against any aggressive behaviour towards the Muslims. There in Makkah, he shouted at the top of his voice and warned against any hostilities advising them to seek safety in his house. His wife got indignant and tugged at his moustache cursing him and abusing his cowardly stance. The people within Makkah mocked Abu Sufyan and dispersed in different directions, some into their houses, others into the Holy Sanctuary, while some undisciplined reckless ruffians led by ‘Ikrimah bin Abi Jahl, Safwan bin Omaiyah and Suhail bin ‘Amr encamped themselves in a place called Khandamah, with murderous intent in their minds.</p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh], on his part, was quite modestly and calmly drawing the final touches for the military breakthrough awaiting the Muslims, by Allâh’s Will. He appointed Khalid bin Al-Waleed as a leader of the right flank of the army with Aslam, Sulaim, Ghifar, Muzainah, and Juhainah tribes under his command to enter Makkah through its lower avenues. Az-Zubair bin ‘Awwam was to lead the left flank and would storm Makkah from the upper side holding up the Messenger’s banner. Abu ‘Ubaidah took command of the infantry and was to penetrate into the city via a side valley. They were given full and decisive orders not to kill unless in self-defense and in that case, they would exterminate any aggressive elements and quell any opposition. </p>
<p>The Muslim battalions marched out each in its already drawn route to fulfill the missions they were supposed to carry out. Khalid bin Al-Waleed worked his way into the heart of the town quite successfully killing twelve of the ruffians and sustaining two martyrs. Az-Zubair set out and reached the fixed destination where he planted the banner at Al-Fath (conquest) Mosque and waited there for the arrival of the Prophet [pbuh]. A tent was pitched for him where he offered prayers of thanks to the All-Mighty Allâh, Who, out of His immense grace, had granted him a splendid victory. </p>
<p>But he did not repose long. He, in the company of the Helpers and Emigrants, got up and proceeded towards Al-Ka‘bah, the Sacred House, which is an emblem of the Oneness and Supremacy of Allâh. It was unfortunately infested with idols that numbered 360. He knocked them down with his bow while reciting the verse of the Noble Qur’ân:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And Say: ‘Truth (i.e. Islamic Monotheism or this Qur’ân or Jihâd against polytheists) has come and Batil (falsehood, i.e. Satan or polytheism, etc.) has vanished. Surely! Batil is ever bound to vanish.’" [Al-Qur'an 17:81] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Allâh further said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): 'The Truth (the Qur’ân and Allah’s Inspiration) has come, and Al-Batil (falsehood - Iblis) can neither create anything nor resurrect (anything)." [Al-Qur'an 34:49] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then started the usual circumambulation on his ride. He was not in a state of Ihram (ritual consecration) then. On completion, he called for ‘Uthman bin Talhah, the janitor of Al-Ka‘bah, from whom he took the key. He went in and saw images of Prophets Ibrahim and Ishmael, [AWS], throwing divination arrows. He denounced these acts of Quraish and ordered that all idols be dismantled, images and effigies deleted. He then entered the sacred hall to face the wall opposite the door and there again performed devout prostrations, and went around acclaiming Allâh’s Greatness and Oneness. Shortly afterwards, he returned to the door-way and standing upon its elevated step, gazed in thankfulness on the thronging multitude below and delivered the following celebrated address:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no god but Allâh Alone. He has no associates. He made good His Promise that He held to His slave and helped him and defeated all the Confederates along. Bear in mind that every claim of privilege, whether that of blood, or property, is under my heel, except that of the custody of Al-Ka‘bah and supplying of water to the pilgrims. Bear in mind that for anyone who is slain, even though semi-deliberately, with club or whip, for him the blood-money is very severe: a hundred camels, forty of them to be pregnant." </p>
<p>"O people of Quraish! surely Allâh has abolished from you all pride of the pre-Islamic era and all conceit in your ancestry, (because) all men are descended from Adam, and Adam was made out of clay." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then recited to them the verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you near Allâh is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. one of the Muttaqûn: i.e. pious and righteous persons who fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)]. Verily, Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Aware." [Al-Qur'an 49:13] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He further added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O you people of Quraish! What do you think of the treatment that I am about to accord to you?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O noble brother and son of noble brother! We expect nothing but goodness from you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon this, he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I speak to you in the same words as Yusuf (the Prophet Joseph) spoke unto his brothers: He said: "No reproach on you this day," [Al-Qur'an 12:92] go your way, for you are freed ones."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the door-keeping of Al-Ka‘bah and supplying of water to pilgrims, the Prophet [pbuh] ordered that these jobs remain in the hands of ‘Uthman bin Talhah and that the key will stay with him and his descendants forever.</p>
<p>When the time for prayer approached, Bilal ascended Al-Ka‘bah and called for prayer. Abu Sufyan bin Harb, ‘Itab bin Usaid and Al-Harith bin Hisham were meanwhile sitting in the yard. ‘Itab bin Usaid commented on the new situation (Bilal ascending Al-Ka‘bah and calling for prayer) saying that Allâh honoured Usaid (his father) having not heard such words. The Prophet [pbuh] approached and assisted by Divine Revelation told them that he had learnt about what they had spoken of. Al-Harith and ‘Itab, taken by incredible surprise, immediately professed Islam and bore witness to the Messengership of Muhammad [pbuh] adding that "We swear by Allâh that none had been with us to inform you."</p>
<p>On that very day, the Prophet [pbuh] entered ‘Umm Hani’s house where he washed and offered prayers of victory. ‘Umm Hani had sheltered two Makkan relatives of hers in her house in which act she was granted support by the Prophet [pbuh]. Shedding blood of nine arch-criminals was declared lawful even under the curtains of Al-Ka‘bah. Nevertheless, only four of them were killed while the others were pardoned for different reasons. </p>
<p>As for those who were killed, mention could be made of ‘Abdul ‘Uzza bin Khatal who had become a Muslim and then deputed to collect alms-tax in the company of a Helper. They had also a slave with them. ‘Abdullah, in a fit of rage, killed the Helper’s slave on account of a mere trifling dispute, and joined the pagan Arabs as an apostate. He was never repentant at this heinous crime but rather employed two women singers and incited them to sing satirically about the Prophet [pbuh]. </p>
<p>The other man who was put to death was Miqyas bin Sababa. He was a Muslim. A Helper accidentally killed his brother Hisham. The Prophet [pbuh] had arranged the payment of blood money to him, which he had accepted. His revengeful nature, however, was never appeased, so he killed the Helper and went to Makkah as an apostate. Similarly, Huwairith and one woman singer went to death. </p>
<p>On the other hand, every attempt was made to grant pardon to the people. ‘Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl, who had attacked Khalid’s detachment at the time of the entry into Makkah, was forgiven. To Wahshi, the murderer of Hamzah, the Prophet’s uncle, and to Hind, who had chewed his liver, was also extended his generous clemency. The same generous treatment was accorded to Habar who had attacked the Prophet’s daughter with a spear, while on her way from Makkah to Madinah, so grievously that she ultimately died of the fatal injuries. </p>
<p>In the same context of magnanimity peculiar to Muhammad [pbuh], two chiefs of Quraish were pardoned once they had embraced Islam. They were Safwan bin Omaiyah and Fudalah bin ‘Umair. The latter had attempted to assassinate the Prophet [pbuh] while circumambulating in the Holy Sanctuary. The Prophet’s matchless tolerance and broad-mindedness instigated by his mission as ‘A mercy to all people’, converted a terrible hypocrite into a faithful devout believer.</p>
<p>On the second day of the great conquest, the Prophet [pbuh] stood up and addressed the people in matters relating to the holy status of Makkah. After entertaining Allâh’s praise, he proclaimed that Makkah was a holy land and would remain so till the Day of Judgement. No bloodshed was allowed therein. Should anyone take the liberty of fighting within Makkah on grounds derived from the events that characterized the conquest, he should remember that it had been a licence granted temporarily to the Prophet, and virtually does not go for others. </p>
<p>Ibn ‘Abbas [R] narrated: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] said: "Allâh has made Makkah, a sanctuary, so it was a sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its fallen things except by a person who would announce that (what has found) publicly." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-‘Abbas said: "O Allâh’s Messenger! Except the lemon grass (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and for our homes." The Prophet [pbuh] then said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Except the lemon grass." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, out of the spirit of revenge, the tribesmen of Khuza‘ah killed a man from Laith Tribe. Here the Prophet was indignant and ordered Khuza‘ah to stop those pre-Islamic practices. He, moreover, gave the family of anyone killed the right to consider either of two options, blood-money or just retribution (the killer is killed). </p>
<p>After having delivered his address, the Prophet [pbuh] rode to a small hill, Safa, not far from Al-Ka‘bah. Turning his face towards the Sacred House, amidst a vast admiring and devotional multitude, he raised his hand in fervent prayer to Allâh. The citizens of Madinah who had gathered round him entertained fear, as Allâh had given him victory over his native city, he might choose to stay here. He insisted on explanation of their fear and so they spoke openly. He immediately dispelled their fears and assured them that he had lived with them and would die with them.</p>
<p>Immediately after the great conquest, the Makkans came to realize that the only way to success lay in the avenue of Islam. They complied with the new realities and gathered to pledge fealty to the Prophet [pbuh]. The men came first pledging full obedience in all areas they could afford. Then came the women to follow the men’s example. The Prophet [pbuh] with ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab receiving the pledge of fealty and communicating to them for him. </p>
<p>Hind bint ‘Utbah, Abu Sufyan’s wife, came in the trail of women disguised lest the Prophet [pbuh] should recognize and account for her, having chewed the liver of Hamzah, his uncle. The Prophet [pbuh] accepted their allegiance on condition that they associate none with Allâh, to which they immediately agreed. He added that they should not practise theft. Here Hind complained that her husband, Abu Sufyan, was tight-fisted. Her husband interrupted, granting all his worldly possessions to her. The Prophet [pbuh] laughed and recognized the woman. She implored him to extend his pardon to her and efface all her previous sins. </p>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] stayed in Makkah for 19 days. During that period he used to define the way to Islam, guide people to the orthodox path. He ordered Abu Usaid Al-Khuza‘i to restore the pillars of the Holy Sanctuary, sent missions to all quarters inviting them to adopt Islam and break down the graven images still lying in the vicinity of Makkah, and he did have all of them scrapped, inculcating in the believers’ ears his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whoever believes in Allâh and the Hereafter is supposed to scrap out the idols that should happen to be in his house." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly after the great conquest, the Prophet [pbuh] began to despatch platoons and errands aiming at eliminating the last symbols reminiscent of pre-Islamic practices. He sent Khalid bin Al-Waleed in Ramadan 8 A.H. to a spot called Nakhlah where there was a goddess called Al-‘Uzza venerated by the Quraish and Kinanah tribes. It had custodians from Bani Shaiban. Khalid, at the head of thirty horsemen, arrived at the spot and exterminated it. On his return, the Prophet [pbuh] asked him if he had seen anything there, to which Khalid gave a negative answer. Here, he was told that it had not been destroyed and he had to go there again and fulfill the task. He went back again and there he saw a black woman, naked with torn hair. Khalid struck her with his sword into two parts. He returned and narrated the story to the Prophet [pbuh], who then confirmed the fulfillment of the task.</p>
<p>Later, in the same month, ‘Amr bin Al-‘As was sent on an errand to destroy another idol, venerated by Hudhail, called Suwa‘. It used to stand at a distance of three kilometres from Makkah. On a question posed by the door-keeper, ‘Amr said he had been ordered by the Prophet [pbuh] to knock down the idol. The man warned ‘Amr that he would not be able to do it. ‘Amr was surprised to see someone still in the wrong, approached the idol and destroyed it, then he broke the casket beside it but found nothing. </p>
<p>The man immediately embraced Islam. </p>
<p>Sa‘d bin Zaid Al-Ashhali was also sent in the same month and on the same mission to Al-Mashallal to destroy an idol, Manat, venerated by both Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj tribes. Here also a black woman, naked with messy hair appeared wailing and beating on her chest. Sa‘d immediately killed her, destroyed the idol and broke the casket and returned at the conclusion of his errand. </p>
<p>Khalid bin Al-Waleed at the head of 350 horsemen of Helpers, Emigrants, and Bani Saleem was dispatched once again in the same year, 8 A.H., to the habitation of Bani Khuzaimah Bedouins to invite them to the fold of Islam. He was instructed to carry out his mission with peace and goodwill. There, the people were not articulate enough to communicate their intentions, so Khalid ordered his men to kill them and take the others as captives. He even had in mind to kill the captives but some of the Companions were opposed to his plan. News of bloodshed reached the Prophet [pbuh]. He was deeply grieved and raised his hands towards the heavens, uttering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Allâh! I am innocent of what Khalid has done." [Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/450, 2/622]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He immediately sent ‘Ali to make every possible reparation to the tribes who had been wronged. After a careful inquiry, ‘Ali paid the blood-money to all those who suffered loss. The remaining portion was also distributed amongst the members of the tribe in order to alleviate their suffering. Khalid, due to his irrational behaviour, had a row with ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf. Hearing this, the Prophet [pbuh] got angry, and ordered Khalid to stop that altercation adding that his Companions (meaning ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf) were too high in rank to be involved in such arguments. </p>
<p>That is the story of the conquest of Makkah and the decisive battle that exterminated paganism once and for all. The other tribes in the Arabian Peninsula were waiting and closely watching the final outcome of the bitter struggle between the Muslims and idolaters, already convinced that the Holy Sanctuary would not fall but in the hands of the righteous party. It had been a conviction deeply established in their minds ever since the elephant army of Abraha Al-Ashram advanced from Yemen intending to destroy the Sacred House 50 years before. </p>
<p>Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty was the natural prelude to this great victory in which people believed deeply and over which people talked a lot. The Muslims in Makkah, who had feared to declare their Faith in public, began to appear and work ardently for this new approach to life. People began to convert into Islam in hosts, and the Muslim army that numbered 3000 only in the previous Ghazwah now came to reach 10,000 in number. </p>
<p>In fact, this decisive change provided people with the keen insight to perceive things and the world around them as a whole in a different perspective. The Muslims were then to steer the whole political and religious affairs of all Arabia. They had monopolized both the religious supremacy and temporal power. The whole post-Hudaibiyah phase had been well-fledged in favour of the new Islamic movement. Streams of the desert Arabians began to pour in paying full homage to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], embracing the new faith and then carrying it to different quarters for propagation.</p>
<hr />
<h1>The Third Stage</h1>
<p>The third and last stage of the life of the Messenger [pbuh] embodies the fruitful results of his call to Islam, which were the consequences of long-timed holy fights in the way of Allâh (Jihad), troubles, toil, disturbances, trials, and a lot of bloody conflicts and battles, which lasted for over twenty years.</p>
<p>The conquest of Makkah was considered the most serious profit achieved by Muslims during those years. For it affected the course of events and consequently altered the Arabs’ whole life. It was a decisive distinction between pre-conquest and post-conquest periods. For Quraish, at that time, was in the eyes of Arabs the defenders and helpers of Arabs. Other Arabs were only their ancillaries. The submission of Quraish is, therefore, estimated to be a final elimination of paganism in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>This stage can be divided into two main phases:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Holy wars and fighting.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The tribes and people’s race to embrace Islam.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Being so close and rather inseparable, the two phases of this stage intervene in such a way that a happening of one phase occurs during the progress of the other. However, for expository purposes, these two phases will be dealt with distinctly. The fighting phase was given priority in order, due to the fact that it is more intimate and fit than the other.</p>
<h2>Hunain Ghazwah</h2>
<p>The conquest of Makkah which came forth as a consequence of a swift blow astounded both the Arabs and other tribes who realized that they were doomed and had to submit to the new situation as a fait accompli. Some of the fierce, powerful, proud tribes did not submit and favoured resistance. Ahead of these were the septs of Hawazin and Thaqif. Nasr, Jashm, and Sa‘d bin Bakr and people of Bani Hilal — all of whom of Qais ‘Ailan. They thought that they were too mighty to admit or surrender to such a victory. So they met Malik bin ‘Awf An-Nasri and made up their mind to proceed fighting against the Muslims.</p>
<h3>The Enemy’s March and their Encampment at Awtas</h3>
<p>When Malik bin ‘Awf — the general leader — decided to march and fight the Muslims, he made his countrypeople take their wealth, women, and children with them to Awtas — which is a valley in Hawazin land and is quite near Hunain. It differs from Hunain in its being adjacent to Dhi-Al-Majaz which is around ten miles from Makkah in ‘Arafat’s direction. [Fath Al-Bari 8/27,42]</p>
<h3>The War-experienced Man Wrong the Leader’s Judgement</h3>
<p>As soon as they had camped in Awtas, people crowded round Malik. The old sane Duraid bin As-Simmah, who was well-known as a war-experienced man and who was among those who gathered round Malik, asked: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What valley are we in?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"In Awtas," they said. "What a good course it is for horses! It is neither a sharp pointed height nor a loosed soiled plain. What? Why do I hear camels’ growling, the donkeys’ braying, the children’s cries and the sheep bleating?" asked Duraid. They said: "Malik bin ‘Awf had made people bring their women, properties, and children with them." </p>
<p>So he called Malik and asked him what made him do such a thing. Malik said that his aim was to have everybody’s family and properties around them so that they fight fiercely to protect them. </p>
<p>"I swear by Allâh that you are nothing but a shepherd," answered Duraid, "Do you believe that there is anything whatsoever that can stand in the way of a defeated one or stop him from fleeing? If you win the battle you avail nothing but a man with a sword and a spear; but if you lose, you will bring disgrace on your people and properties," then he resumed his talk and went on wondering about some septs and their leaders. </p>
<p>"O Malik, thrusting the distinguished people of Hawazin into the battlefield will avail you nothing. Raise them up to where they can be safe. Then make the young people mount their horses and fight. If you win, those whom you tarried will follow you, but if you were the loser it would be a loss of a battle, but your kinsmen, people, and properties would not be lost." </p>
<p>But Malik, the general leader, refused this suggestion. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By Allâh," he said, "I will not do such a thing. You must have grown senile. Hawazin have to obey me, or else I will lean my body against this sword so that it penetrates through my back."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He rejected any sort of contribution of Duraid’s in that concern. </p>
<p>"We obey you," said his people, Duraid consequently said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Today is a day that I have not missed but surely I will not be tempted to witness."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Reconnoitering the Weapons of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]</h3>
<p>The spies that Malik had already dispatched to spy on Muslim forces returned with their limbs cut off. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Woe unto you! What happened to you?" said Malik. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They said: "We have seen distinguished people on spotted horsebacks. What you see would not have happened if we had been firmly together." </p>
<h3>Reconnoitering the Enemy’s Weapons</h3>
<p>News about the enemy’s marching was conveyed to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], so he sent out Al-Aslami with orders to mix with people, stay with them so that he would know their news and convey it to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] when he turns back. That was exactly what he managed to do. </p>
<h3>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] Leaves Makkah for Hunain</h3>
<p>On Shawwal, the nineteenth, the captive day, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] left Makkah accompanied by twelve thousand Muslims. Ten thousand of those had previously shared in Makkah Conquest. A great number of the other two thousand, who were Makkans, had recently embraced Islam. That march was on the nineteenth day of his conquest of Makkah. </p>
<p>He borrowed a hundred armours with their equipment from Safwan bin Omaiyah. He appointed ‘Itab bin Usaid as a governor over Makkah. When it was evening time, a horseman came to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have climbed up so and so mountains and came across Hawazin with their riding camels, livestock and sheep. Hawazin wholly were gathered together there." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] smiled then and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They will all be Muslims’ spoils tomorrow, if Allâh wills."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That night Anas bin Abi Murthid Al-Ghanawi volunteered to guard. [Abu Da'ud] </p>
<p>On their way to Hunain they saw a great green Nabk plant, that was called Dhat-Anwat (the one with suspenders). That was because the Arabs used to hang their weapons on it, slay beasts under it, and keep to it. So some of the army members asked the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to make them a Nabk with suspenders as the one they had. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allâh is the Greatest of all!" He said, "I swear by the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad’s soul, that you have just said what the people of Moses said to him. They said, ‘Make us a god as the one they have.’ Surely you are ignorant people. These are Sunnah, but you will follow and comply with the modes of life of those who preceded you." [At-Tirmidhi] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing how great in number the army was, some of them said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We shall not be defeated." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their statement sounded hard upon the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. </p>
<h3>The Islamic Army Stunned the Archers and the Attackers</h3>
<p>On Wednesday night the tenth of Shawwal, the Muslim army arrived at Hunain. Malik bin ‘Awf, who had previously entered the valley by night, gave orders to his army to hide inside the valley and lurk for the Muslims on roads, entrances, and narrow hiding places. His orders to his men were to hurl stones at Muslims whenever they caught sight of them and then to make a one-man attack against them. </p>
<p>At early dawn the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] started mobilizing his army and distributing posts and flags to people. In the dark and just before dawn, the Muslims moved towards Hunain Valley. They started descending into it unaware of the presence of an enemy lurking for them inside the valley. So at the moment they were camping, arrows began showering intensively at them, whereas the enemy’s battalions started a fierce attack against the Muslims, who had to retreat in disorder and utter confusion. It was such a shatteringly defeat that Abu Sufyan bin Harb, who had recently embraced Islam, said that their retreat would not stop till they got to the Red Sea. Jablah or Kildah bin Al-Junaid commented on that by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Surely magic has grown inactive today."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] turned to the right and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Come on, people! I am the Messenger of Allâh. I am Muhammad, the son of Abdullah." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who stood fast by him were only a few Emigrants and some of his kinsmen. The matchless bravery of the Prophet [pbuh] was then brought to light. He went on and on in his attempts to make his mule stand fast in the face of the disbelievers while saying loudly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Truly saying, I am the Prophet, I am the (grand) son of Abdul Muttalib." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Abu Sufyan, who was then holding the rein of the Prophet’s mule, and Al-‘Abbas, who was holding its stirrup, were endeavouring to make it halt. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] dismounted and asked his Lord to render him help. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O, Allâh, send down Your Help!" </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Muslims’ Return to the Battlefield, and the Fierceness of the Fight</h3>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered his uncle Al-‘Abbas — who was a sonorous voiced man — to call out on the followers. As loudly as he could, Al-‘Abbas shouted: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Where are the lancers?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"By Allâh," Al-‘Abbas said, "Upon hearing my voice calling them back, they turned round to the battlefield as if they had been oryxes (wild cows) tending towards their calves." </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Here we are, at your service. Here we are." [Sahih Muslim 2/100]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They said. There you see them trying to stop their camels and reverse to the battle. He who was unable to force his camel to turn back would take his armour, fling it round his neck, and hastily dismount his camel with his weapon in his hand letting his camel move freely and run towards the voice source. Voices would grow louder and louder till a hundred of them gathered round the Prophet and resumed the fight. </p>
<p>Those who were called out upon next were Al-Ansar, the Helpers, "O, folks of Al-Ansar! Folks of Al-Ansar!" The last group to be called out upon were Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. Muslims battalions poured successively into the battlefield in the same manner that they had left it. The stamina of both parties was superb. Both of them stood fast and fought fiercely. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was so eagerly and furiously watching the battle that he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now the fight has grown fierce." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Picking up a handful of earth, he hurled it at their faces while saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"May your faces be shameful." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their eyes were thick with dust and the enemy began to retreat in utter confusion.</p>
<h3>Reverse of Fortunes and the Enemy’s Utter Defeat</h3>
<p>A few hours had elapsed since the earth-handful was hurled at the enemy’s faces when they were shatteringly defeated. About seventy men of Thaqif alone were killed, and the Muslims plundered all their riding camels, weapons, and cattle. Allâh, Glory is to Him, alluded to this sudden change in the Qur’ân when He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...on the Day of Hunain (battle) when you rejoiced at your great number but it availed you naught and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you, then you turned back in flight. Then Allâh did send down His Sakinah (calmness, tranquillity, and reassurance, etc.) on the Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) and on the believers, and sent down forces (angels) which you saw not, and punished the disbelievers. Such is the recompense of disbelievers." [Al-Qur'an 9:25,26] </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Hot Pursuit of the Enemy</h3>
<p>After their defeat, some enemy troops headed for Ta’if, others to Nakhlah and Awtas. A group of Muslims headed by Abu ‘Amir Al-Ash‘ ari, were despatched to chase the enemy; some skirmishes took place during which Abu ‘Amir was killed. </p>
<p>A similar battalion of horsemen pursued the idolaters who threaded the track to Nakhlah and caught up with Duraid bin As-Simmah, who was killed by Rabi‘a bin Rafi‘. After collecting the booty, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] left for Ta’if to face the greatest number of the defeated idolaters. The booty was six thousand captives, twenty-four thousand camels; over forty thousand sheep, and four thousand silver ounces. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] gave orders that booty should be confined at Al-J‘iranah and ordained Mas‘ud bin ‘Amr Al-Ghifari to be in charge of it. It was only when he was entirely free from Ta’if Campaign, that one of the captives As-Shaimâ’, the daughter of Al-Harith As-Sa‘diya, the Messenger’s foster sister was brought to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]; she introduced herself to him. </p>
<p>Upon recognizing her by a certain mark, he honoured her, spread for her his garment and seated her on it. He was graceful and released her and made her turn back to her people.  </p>
<h2>Ta’if Campaign</h2>
<p>The Ta’if Campaign is, in fact, an extension of the Hunain Ghazwah; that is because the majority of the defeated troops of Hawazin and Thaqif went into Ta’if with the general commander — Malik bin ‘Awf An-Nasri — and fortified themselves within it. So upon finishing with the Hunain Invasion, he gathered the booty at Al-Ji‘ranah in the very month (i.e. Shawwal) and in the eighth year A.H. </p>
<p>A vanguard battalion of a thousand men led by Khalid bin Al-Waleed marched towards At-Ta’if. Whereas the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] proceeded passing through Nakhlah Al-Yamaniyah, Qarn Al-Manazil and through Laiyah. At Laiyah, there was a castle that belonged to Malik bin ‘Awf, so the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] gave orders to have it destroyed. He resumed his march till he got to Ta’if. There he dismounted, camped near its castle and laid siege to the castle inhabitants; but not for long. How long the siege continued, is still a matter of disagreement. It, however, stands between 10-20 days. [Sahih Muslim, narrated by Anas [AWS]; Fath Al-Bari 8/45] </p>
<p>A lot of arrow-shooting and rock-hurling occurred during the siege. For as soon as the Muslims laid siege around the castle, its people started shooting arrows against them. The arrows were so intense and fierce that they looked as if they had been locusts on the move. A number of Muslims were wounded and twelve were killed. To be far from the arrow range, the Muslims had to ascend to a higher location and camped on — i.e. to what is now called At-Ta’if Mosque. </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] set up a mangonel and shelled the castle. Eventually, a gap was made in the castle wall, through which a number of Muslims managed to pass into the castle, sheltered by a wooden tank, with the purpose of setting fire into it. Anyway, the enemy poured down molten hot iron on them. Affected by this, the Muslims stepped out of the tank and were again exposed to arrow shooting and consequently some of them were killed. </p>
<p>To force the enemy to surrender, the Prophet [pbuh] tended to a war policy of burning and cutting the enemy’s crops. His order was to cut their vineyards and burn them. Seeing that the Muslims started rapidly cutting and burning their vines, they implored the Prophet [pbuh] to stop and have mercy on them for the sake of Allâh and out of kinship motives. So the Prophet agreed. When the caller of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] called out unto people saying, "He whosoever descends and steps out of the castle is free." Twenty-three men came out. [Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/620] One of them was Abu Bakrah who tied himself to a wall and let himself down by means of a small wheel that would normally be used for drawing up water from a well. The way he let himself down made the Prophet nickname him "Abu Bakrah", i.e. the man with the wheel. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] set them all free and entrusted each one of them to a Muslim to care about their living affairs, which was too hard for the castle folkspeople to bear.</p>
<p>Seeing that the siege lasted too long and that the castle was immune and could stand any siege (for they had already stored a supply that suffices for over a year) and that the Muslims were suffering — day by day — from arrow shots and heated iron hooks, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] consulted Nawfal bin Mu‘âwiyah Ad-Daili about that. </p>
<p>He said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They are like a fox hiding inside its burrow. If you stood fast at it you would catch it, but if you parted with it, no harm would afflict you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] decided to lift the siege and depart. ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, who was ordered by the Prophet to notify people, said to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If Allâh wills, we are leaving the castle and going back tomorrow."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it was too hard for the Muslims to go back and leave the castle unconquered, they complained saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Should we go away while the castle is still unopened?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His reply was: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then, start fighting in the morning." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the morning they fought and were wounded. So when he repeated this statement: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If Allâh wills, we are leaving the castle and going back tomorrow," </p>
</blockquote>
<p>they were pleased and carried out the order submissively and started moving, which made the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] laugh. </p>
<p>As soon as they mounted and started moving the Messenger [pbuh] said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Say! Here we are returning, repenting, worshipping (Allâh) and to our Lord we offer praise." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Messenger of Allâh was asked to invoke Allâh against Thaqif, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Allâh, guide Thaqif and bring them to us as Muslims."  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Distribution of the Booty at Al-Ji‘ranah</h3>
<p>Upon returning and lifting the siege in Ta’if, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had stayed over ten nights at Al-Ji‘ranah before starting to distribute the booty. Distribution delay was due to the Prophet’s hope that Hawazin’s delegation might arrive and announce their repentance and consequently reclaim their loss. Seeing that none of them arrived, he started dividing the booty so as to calm down the tribes’ chiefs and the celebrities of Makkah. </p>
<p>The first to receive the booty and the ones who obtained the greatest number of shares were the people who had recently embraced Islam. Abu Sufyan bin Harb was given a hundred camels and forty (gold) ounces and yet he said, "What about my son, Yazeed’s Share?" So he was given the same quantity for his son as well. But yet he exclaimed: "And what about the share of Mu‘âwiyah, my second son?" So the Prophet [pbuh] gave Mu‘âwiyah as much as he gave his father and brother. Hakeem bin Hizam was given a hundred camels, but he was given a hundred more when he demanded. Safwan bin Omaiyah was given three hundred camels - a hundred camels at each time. </p>
<p>It is thus mentioned in Shifâ’ [Ash-Shifa 1/86], Book by Qadi Iyadh. The Prophet [pbuh] gave Al-Harith bin Harith bin Kilda a hundred camels. He also gave some chiefs of Quraish and other clans a hundred camels; he gave others fifty and some others had forty. </p>
<p>Eventually it was spread among people that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Muhammad grants generously and fears not to grow poor." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made Bedouins gather around him expecting to be given some wealth. They were so many that they forced the Prophet [pbuh] to seek refuge against a tree and they even took away his garment, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O people!" He said, "Give me back my garment! For I swear by the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad’s soul, that if I had as many numerous camels as the number of Tihama trees, I would distribute them among you. You know quite well that I am neither mean nor coward nor a liar." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standing by his camel, he plucked out a hair of his camel’s hump and held it between his two fingers, lifted it up and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O people, I swear by Allâh that I get nothing but one-fifth of your booty, and this very fifth goes back to you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as he had given the new converts, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered Zaid bin Thabit to fetch the booty and summon people. Then he ordained shares for people. A footman’s share was four camels and forty sheep, and a horseman would take twelve camels and a hundred and twenty sheep. This distribution of booty was based on a wise policy. In this world, there are lots of people who know the truth only when it comes through their stomachs and they do not recognize it if it comes through their brains. </p>
<p>The similitude of such people is as the guidance of an animal to its herd by means of a bunch of clover held at a constant distance off its mouth. The animal would try all the time to catch it, so it would eventually go into the herd safely. In the same way, you have to do various kinds of temptations to make certain kinds of people familiar with Islam and be pleased with. [Fiqh As-Seerah p.298,299]</p>
<h3>The Helpers (Al-Ansar) Are Furious at the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]</h3>
<p>At first, the Prophet’s policy of distribution was uncomprehended by many a man. Therefore sharp-tongued people started expressing their objections. The Helpers were among those who were afflicted by this policy. They were deprived of Hunain gifts though they had been the ones who were summoned at Hunain hard times and they were the first to rush to fight with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and stand fast till the defeat turned into victory. Now here they are watching those who escaped fill their hands with booty while they are given nothing. </p>
<p>On the authority of Ibn Ishaq: </p>
<p>"When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] had given Quraish and Arab tribes those gifts and allotted nothing to the Helpers, a group of the Helpers felt so uneasy about it that a lot of ill-statements against the Prophet [pbuh] were spread among them to an extent that one of them said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By Allâh, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was ill-spoken of by his folksmen!" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And those ill-statements went on spreading till Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah met the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], who in his turn faced his people after a while. </p>
<p>Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Messenger of Allâh, this group of the Helpers are furious at you about the distribution of the booty that you had won. You have allotted shares to your own kinsmen and forwarded lots of gifts to the Arab tribes. But this group has obtained nothing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] asked Sa‘d exclaiming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sa‘d, what do you think of all that?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sa‘d replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Messenger of Allâh. You know that I am nothing but a member of this group." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Call out on your people and bring them forth to me into this shed." Said the Prophet [pbuh]. </p>
<p>So Sa‘d went out and summoned them. When some Emigrants came, he let them in but forbade others. When they were all gathered together, he informed the Prophet saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This group of the Helpers have just arrived to meet you in compliance with your orders." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as the Messenger [pbuh] faced them he thanked Allâh and praised Him, then said to them inquiring, </p>
<p>"I have been told that you are angry with me. Didn’t I come to you when you were astray and Allâh guided you? You were poor and Allâh gave you wealth. Weren’t you foes and Allâh made you love one another." </p>
<p>"Yes," they said, "Allâh and His Messenger are better and more gracious." </p>
<p>Then he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What prevents you from replying to the Messenger of Allâh, O tribe of Helpers?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They said, "What should be the reply, O Messenger of Allâh, while to the Lord and to His Messenger belong all benevolence and grace." </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] again said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But by Allâh, you might have answered and answered truly, for I would have testified to its truth myself: ‘You came to us belied and rejected and we accepted you; you came to us as helpless and we helped you; a fugitive, and we took you in; poor and we comforted you’. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You Helpers, do you feel anxious for the things of this world, wherewith I have sought to incline these people unto the Faith in which you are already established? </p>
<p>Are you not satisfied, O group of Helpers that the people go with ewes and camels while you go along with the Messenger of Allâh ([pbuh]) to your dwellings? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By Him in Whose Hand is my life, had there been no migration, I would have been one of the Helpers. If the people would go through a valley and passage, and the Helpers go through another valley and passage, I would go through the valley and passage of the Helpers. Allâh! Have mercy on the Helpers, their children, and their children’s children." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The audience wept until tears rolled down their beards as they said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, we are satisfied, O Prophet of Allâh ([pbuh] )! with our lot and share." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the Prophet [pbuh] left the gathering and the people also dispersed. [Ibn Hisham 2/499,500; and like this quoted by Bukhari 2/620, 621] </p>

<h1>Arrival of the Hawazin Delegation</h1>
<p>Hawazin’s delegation arrived at Muslims just after the distribution of spoils. They were fourteen men headed by Zuhair bin Sard. The Messenger’s foster uncle was one of them. They asked him to bestow upon them some of the wealth and spoils. They uttered so touching words that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to them: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You surely see who are with me. The most desirable speech to me is the most truthful. Which is dearer to you, your wealth or your women and children?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nothing whatsoever compares with kinship." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when I perform the noon prayer, stand up and say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We intercede with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to exhort the believers, and we intercede with the believers to exhort the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to forego the captives of our people fallen to their lot." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] performed the noon prayer, they stood up and said what they had been told to say. The Messenger [pbuh], then, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As for what belongs to me and to the children of Abdul Muttalib, you may consider them, from now on, yours. And I will ask my folksmen to give back theirs." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon hearing that the Emigrants and the Helpers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What belongs to us is, from now on, offered to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Al-Aqra‘ bin Habis said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We will grant none of what belongs to me and to Bani Tamim," </p>
</blockquote>
<p>so did ‘Uyaina bin Hisn, who said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As for me and Bani Fazarah, I say ‘No’." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-‘Abbas bin Mirdas also refused and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No" for Bani Saleem and him. His people, however, said otherwise: </p>
<p>"Whatever spoils belong to us we offer to the Messenger of Allâh ([pbuh])."</p>
<p>"You have undermined my position." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Said Al-‘Abbas bin Mirdas spontaneously. Then the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These people have come to you as Muslims. For this, I have already tarried the distribution of the booty. Besides, I have granted them a fair option but they refused to have anything other than their women and children. Therefore he who has some of theirs and will prefer willingly to give them back, let them do. But those who favour to keep what he owns to himself, let them grant them back too, and he will be given as a recompense six times as much from the first booty that Allâh may provide us." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>People then said, "We will willingly offer them all for the sake of the Messenger of Allâh." The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But in this way we are not able to find out who is content and who is not. So go back and we will be waiting for your chiefs to convey to us your decisions." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of them gave back the women and children. The only one who refused to comply with the Messenger’s desire was ‘Uyaina bin Hisn. He refused to let an old woman of theirs go back at first. Later on he let her go back. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] gave every captive a garment as a gift.</p>

<h1>Lesser Pilgrimage (Al-‘Umrah) to Makkah and Leaving for Madinah</h1>
<p>Having accomplished the distribution of the spoils at Al-Ji‘ranah he left it while wearing Al-‘Umrah clothes and proceeded to Makkah to perform Al-‘Umrah. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] turned back from there to Madinah after appointing ‘Itab bin Usaid on Makkah as governor. His arrival in Madinah was by the last six nights of Dhul-Qa‘dah, in the year 8 A.H. </p>
<p>On this occasion, Muhammad Al-Ghazali said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What a great change it is between the victorious period of Muhammad at present which Allâh has towered with a manifest conquest, and that period of the past during which Muhammad first arrived at this town, eight years ago." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he first came to Madinah, he was pursued and wanted. He was seeking a secure shelter. He was a lonely stranger who sought companionship and comfort. The people of Madinah welcomed him, gave him residence and aided him and embraced the light of Islam, which had been sent down upon him. They, for his sake, did not care about the enmity of other peoples. Here he is entering Madinah again, after the lapse of eight years of that first visit. Madinah, the town that had received him once, when he was a frightened Emigrant; it receives him once again when Makkah has become in his hands and at his disposal. It is Makkah that has got rid of its pride and Jahiliyah (i.e. pre-Islamic period and traditions). It is now proud again and mighty in Islam. The Messenger of Allâh forgave all the errors and wrongs of its people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Verily, he who fears Allâh with obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allâh makes not the reward of the good-doers to be lost." [Al-Qur'an 12:90] </p>
