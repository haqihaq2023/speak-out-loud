<p>The text narrates an episode following the Battle of Uhud, a crucial event in early Islamic history, where the Quraish, despite their partial victory, contemplate a risky return to battle against the Muslims. Safwan bin Omaiyah, an experienced Quraish leader, warns against this, fearing the Muslims might regroup and retaliate. Despite the majority's initial eagerness for revenge, this prudence eventually prevails when Ma‘bad bin Abu Ma‘bad cleverly exaggerates Muslim numbers. This psychological warfare instills fear among the Quraish, leading them to decide against further hostilities and ultimately withdraw to Makkah, leaving behind only propaganda and threats to intimidate the Muslims.</p>
<p>The aftermath of Uhud, with its significant Muslim casualties, poses a question about the nature of the event—whether it was a true defeat. Despite the losses, the Muslim camp remains untouched, and no spoils are gained by the Makkans, suggesting their failure to achieve conclusive victory. The Muslims’ resilience in the face of adversity, along with the strategic withdrawal of the Quraish, reveals the complexity of the battle's outcome. These events highlight the enduring spirit and faith of the Muslims, who declare reliance on Allah’s sufficiency, as embodied in the Quranic verses revealed in its context.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the text reflects on the lessons derived from Uhud, underscoring the role of obedience to divine commands as crucial for Muslim success. The events following Uhud illustrate how even setbacks can serve the divine purpose, distinguishing true believers from pretenders and hypocrites. Prophets encounter trials, with ultimate triumph as part of their missions, ensuring only genuine followers remain steadfast. Such experiences are tests of patience and faith, offering believers opportunities for spiritual growth, and serve as divine means to manifest justice against opponents of faith.</p>
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<h2>Military Platoons and Missions between the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Confederates</h2>
<p>Uhud’s misfortune left a bad impact on both the credibility and military reputation of the Muslims. Their dignity and power in people’s eyes were impaired. Troubles and dangers spread everywhere in and out of Madinah. The Jews, hypocrites, and bedouins declared publicly their enmity to the Muslims, and each party was keen on degrading and, ultimately, exterminating their whole existence.</p>
<p>Two months had almost passed after this battle when Banu Asad made preparations to raid Madinah. ‘Udal and Qarah tribes conspired against the Muslims in the month of Safar, 4 A.H., and killed ten of the Prophet [pbuh]’s Companions. Similarly, Banu ‘Amir plotted against them too, leading to the killing of seventy Companions in the battle of Ma‘una Well. During that period, Banu Nadeer kept on announcing their enmity and were involved in a plot to kill the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh] in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal in 4 A.H. Banu Ghatfan were about to attack Madinah in Jumada Al-Ula in 4 A.H.</p>
<p>Thus, we see that the Muslims turned into an attractive target for several potential dangers after they had lost their military credibility in the battle of Uhud. Muhammad [pbuh] managed to hold all those hostile currents at bay, redeem the lost dignity of the Muslims, and gain them anew fresh glory and noble standing. The first initiative he took in this process was Hamra’ Al-Asad pursuit operation, whereby he could retain the Muslim military reputation. He succeeded in recovering his followers’ dignity and awe-inspiring position, astonishing both the Jews and hypocrites alike. He then proceeded to crown his successful attempts by dispatching military errands and missions.</p>
<h3>Abi Salamah Mission</h3>
<p>The first people to take up arms against the Muslims in the aftermath of Uhud's reverse were Banu Asad bin Khuzaimah. "The Intelligence Corps" of Madinah reported that Talhah and Salamah, sons of Khuwailid, had mustered some volunteers to fight the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. The Prophet [pbuh] immediately dispatched a 150-man-platoon of Helpers and Emigrants headed by Abu Salamah. The Muslim leader took Bani Asad bin Khuzaimah by surprise in their own homeland, neutralized their attempts, dispersed them, and captured their cattle. On his return, Abu Salamah had an inflammation of a previous wound he sustained in Uhud, which caused him to die soon after. This expedition took place on Muharram 1st, 4 A.H.</p>
<h3>An Errand led by ‘Abdullah bin Unais</h3>
<p>On the fifth day of the same month, Muharram, 4 A.H., it was reported that Khalid bin Sufyan Al-Hudhali was gathering a mob to raid the Muslim positions. ‘Abdullah bin Unais, at the behest of the Prophet [pbuh], set out to destroy the enemies.</p>
<p>The Muslim military leader stayed away for eighteen days during which he successfully fulfilled his task, killed the head of the rebels, and brought his head back to Madinah on Saturday, seven days before the end of Muharram. The Prophet [pbuh], as a reward, gave him a stick saying, "This will function as a sign of recognition for you and me on the Day of Resurrection." On his deathbed, ‘Abdullah requested that the log be with him in his shroud.</p>
<h3>The Event of Ar-Raji‘</h3>
<p>In Safar of the fourth year A.H., a delegation from the tribes of ‘Udal and Qarah asked the Prophet [pbuh] to send a group of Companions to instruct them in religion, claiming the existence of some Muslims among them. He sent six of his Companions, in another version, ten, headed by Murthid bin Abi Murthid Al-Ghanawi or, according to Al-Bukhari, ‘Asim bin Thabit, the grandfather of ‘Asim bin ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab. When they reached a spot called Ar-Raji‘ between Rabigh and Jeddah, a hundred archers of Banu Lihyan clan surrounded the place and attacked them. The delegation of Muslims took shelter on some high ground, Fudfud, and the bedouins offered them a pledge that they would not be killed. ‘Asim refused to come down; instead, he fought them until he and six of his companions were killed. Three men were left, Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathna, and another one. Once again, the bedouins offered them a guarantee of safety, and they accepted. When they descended, the bedouins treacherously bound them. The third man rebuked them for their insincerity and resisted them, so they killed him. The other two men, who had killed some notables of Quraish at Badr, were taken and sold in Makkah. The first was Khubaib, who was detained for some time and then it was unanimously decided to crucify him. He was taken from the Holy Sanctuary to At-Tan‘im for crucifixion. He requested a respite to offer a two-Rak‘a prayer. After the final greeting, he turned to his executioners and said, "Had I not been afraid that you would think that I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a long time." It was then that Khubaib first set the tradition of praying two Rak‘a before being executed.</p>
<p>He then said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Lord! Count them one by one, exterminate them to the last one." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then recited some verses of poetry which speak eloquently of the atrocities borne by him and testify to his Faith in Allâh at this hour of suffering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The confederates have gathered their tribes around me,<br />
And summoned all of them who could come.<br />
They have gathered their women and children,<br />
I am bound fastly to a lofty trunk.<br />
To Allâh alone I complain of my helplessness and sufferings,<br />
And of the death, the confederates have prepared for me.<br />
Lord of the Throne! Give me endurance against their design,<br />
They have cut my flesh bit by bit, and I have been deprived of sustenance.<br />
They let me choose infidelity, but death is preferable,<br />
Tears roll out of my eyes, though not of fear.<br />
By Allâh! I fear not if I die a Muslim,<br />
On what side I fall for the sake of Allâh.<br />
I will not show subservience to the enemy,<br />
If Lord so desires, He will bless my torn limbs and broken joints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abu Sufyan then addressed him, saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I adjure you by Allâh, don’t you wish that Muhammad [pbuh] were here in your place so that we might cut off his head, and that you were with your family?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Khubaib answered, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By Allâh, I do not wish that Muhammad [pbuh] now were in the place I occupy or that a thorn could hurt him, and that I were sitting with my family."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quraish ordered ‘Uqbah bin Al-Harith, whose father had been killed by Khubaib himself, to crucify him. They also appointed someone to guard his corpse. ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari played a cunning trick and carried the corpse stealthily at night to bury it somewhere. It was later reported that shortly before his crucifixion, he was seen eating a bunch of grapes although there was not even one date available in Makkah at that time. In fact, it was nothing but sustenance bestowed upon him by Allâh.</p>
<p>Safwan bin Omaiyah purchased the second man, Zaid bin Ad-Dathna, and killed him as an act of vengeance for his father’s murder. </p>
<p>Quraish, whom ‘Asim had killed one of their notables, sent someone to fetch a portion of his body, but to their disappointment, his corpse was inaccessible because a large swarm of hornets had been shielding him against any malicious tampering. ‘Asim had already given his Lord a pledge to remain immune against any polytheist tampering concerning his body and also stay detached from any contact with the enemies of Allâh. ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, when hearing this piece of news exclaimed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allâh verily protects His believing slave after death just as He does during his lifespan."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Tragedy of Ma‘una Well</h3>
<p>The Ma‘una Well tragedy, which was even more horrible than that of Ar-Raji‘, took place in the same month.</p>
<p>Abu Bara’ — ‘Amir bin Malik — nicknamed ‘Spear Player’ came to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] in Madinah. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] called him to embrace Islam, but he neither agreed nor refused. He said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Messenger of Allâh, if you dispatch some of your Companions to the people of Najd to call them to Islam, I expect them to accept." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I am afraid the people of Najd will kill them," said the Messenger. But he replied, "I will protect them." </p>
<p>Ibn Ishaq confirms that forty men were sent to them; but As-Sahih states that they were seventy — Al-Mundhir bin ‘Amr, one of Bani Sa‘ida, nicknamed ‘Freed to Die’ — commanded that group, who were the best and most learned in the Qur’ân and jurisprudence. </p>
<p>On their way to Najd, they used to gather firewood to buy food for the people of ‘Ahl As-Suffah’ as charity by day and study, meditate on the meanings of the Qur’ân by night. They kept on doing that until they arrived at Ma‘una Well — which was a well between Bani ‘Amir, Harrah, and Bani Saleem. They stayed there and sent the Message of the Prophet [pbuh] with Haram bin Milhan, the brother of Umm Sulaim, to the enemy of Allâh ‘Amir bin At-Tufail. ‘Amir did not heed the Message but rather ordered a man to spear Haram in the back. When the spear penetrated Haram’s body, he saw the blood and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allâhu Akbar! (i.e. Allâh is the Greatest) By Lord of Al-Ka‘bah I have won!" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the enemy of Allâh promptly called out Bani ‘Amir to fight the rest. Bani ‘Amir refused because they were under the protection of Abu Bara’. Therefore he turned to Bani Saleem for help. The people of ‘Usaiyah, Ri‘al, and Dhakwan, who were folks of Bani Saleem, responded to his call. The Companions of the Prophet [pbuh], who were encompassed by idolaters, kept on fighting until they were all killed. The only survivor was Ka‘b bin Zaid bin An-Najjar, who was carried wounded from among the dead. It was in the Al-Khandaq (the trench) Battle that he was killed.</p>
<p>‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari and Al-Mundhir bin ‘Uqbah bin ‘Amir, who were entrusted with the Muslims’ animals far from them, saw the birds circling in the air over the battleground. Al-Mundhir rushed to share in the fight until he was killed. But ‘Amr bin Omaiyah was captured. ‘Amir set him free when he knew that he was of Mudar tribe, but only after he had cut his hair to fulfill a pledge of his mother’s to set a slave free.</p>
<p>Returning to the Prophet [pbuh], ‘Amr bin Omaiyah conveyed the news of the painful disaster, which resulted in the murder of seventy of the best believers, recalling the tragedy of Uhud — but with the difference that those of Uhud were killed in a clear war but those of Ma‘una were killed in disgraceful treachery. On his way back to Qarqara, ‘Amr bin Omaiyah rested in the shade of a tree, and there two men of Bani Kilab joined him. When they slept, ‘Amr killed them both, thinking that by doing that he would avenge some of his killed companions. Then he found out that they had been given a pledge of protection by the Prophet [pbuh]. He told the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] what he had done. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said to ‘Amr: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You have killed two people; their blood-money shall be a debt I have to discharge." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then engaged himself in collecting their blood-money from the Muslims and their allies, the Jews. This very act was later to trigger the invasion of Bani An-Nadeer.</p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] was so deeply moved by this tragedy and that of Ar-Raji‘ that he used to invoke Allâh’s wrath against those people and tribes who killed his Companions. Anas reported that for thirty days the Prophet [pbuh] supplicated Allâh against those who killed his Companions at Ma‘una Well. Every dawn prayer he would invoke Allâh’s wrath against Ri‘l, Dhakwan, Lihyan, and ‘Usaiyah. He would say, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"‘Usaiyah disobeyed Allâh and His Messenger." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, Allâh sent down unto His Messenger a Qur’ânic verse that we kept on reciting until it was abrogated later on: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inform our folk that we have encountered our Lord and He is satisfied with us and we are satisfied with Him." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] stopped his invocation.</p>
<h3>Bani An-Nadeer Invasion</h3>
<p>We have already spoken about the disgraceful behaviour of the Jews and how they were always thirsting to shed the blood of the Muslims and undermine the cause of Islam, despite all the covenants and pledges they had given to the Prophet [pbuh]. Their behaviour fluctuated between resignation and slackness after the Banu Qainuqa‘ event and the murder of Ka‘b bin Al-Ashraf, and rebellion coupled with treacherous clandestine contacts with Quraish and the hypocrites in order to establish an alliance against the Muslims after the battle of Uhud. Being inexperienced in war tactics, they resorted to conspiracy and intrigue. They first declared open hatred and enmity, playing all sorts of tricks that might harm the Muslims, but they were very careful not to initiate any hostilities that might involve them in open war.</p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh], on his part, exercised the highest degree of patience with them, but they went too far in their provocative deeds, especially after the Ar-Raji‘ and Ma‘una Well events; they even made an attempt on his life.</p>
<p>Once the Prophet [pbuh] with some of his Companions set out to see Banu Nadeer and seek their help in raising the blood-money he had to pay to Bani Kalb for the two men that ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari had killed by mistake. All of that was in accordance with the clauses of the treaty that both parties had already signed. On hearing his story, they said they would share in paying the blood-money and asked him and his Companions Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Ali, and others to sit under a wall of their houses and wait. The Jews held a short private meeting and conspired to kill the Prophet [pbuh]. The most wicked among them, ‘Amr bin Jahsh, volunteered to climb up the wall and drop a large millstone on his head. One of them, Salam bin Mashkam, cautioned them against perpetrating such a crime, predicting that Allâh would divulge their plot to him and added that such an act would constitute a manifest violation of the pact concluded with the Muslims.</p>
<p>In fact, Gabriel did come down to reveal to the Prophet [pbuh] their wicked criminal intention, so he, with his Companions, hurried off back to Madinah. On their way, he told his Companions of the Divine Revelation.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Prophet [pbuh] delegated Muhammad bin Maslamah to communicate an ultimatum to Bani Nadeer to the effect that they should evacuate Madinah within ten days; otherwise, their heads would be cut off. The chief of the hypocrites, ‘Abdullah bin Ubai, urged the Jews not to pay heed to the Prophet [pbuh]’s words and to stay in their habitations, offering to run to their support with two thousand of his followers and assuring them of help to come from the Quraizah tribe and former allies Banu Ghatfan.</p>
<p>In this regard, Allâh says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you are expelled, we (too) indeed will go out with you, and we shall never obey anyone against you, and if you are attacked (in fight), we shall indeed help you." [Al-Qur'an 59:11]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Jews regained their confidence and were determined to fight. Their chief, Huyai bin Akhtab, relied hopefully on what the chief of the hypocrites said. So he sent to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We will not leave our houses. Do whatever you like to do."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly the situation was awkward for the Muslims. Launching a war against their opponents at this critical stage could entail terrible far-reaching ramifications in light of the unfavourable conditions they were passing through, besides the hostile environment growing in power and hatred around them, which culminated in the killing of the Muslim missions, as it has already been introduced.</p>
<p>The Jews of Bani Nadeer were also a power to count for, and the prospects of inflicting a military defeat on them were precarious; consequently, forcing them into war engagement would be attended with unpredictable risks. On the other hand, the continual state of repeated assassinations and acts of treachery carried out against the Muslims individually and collectively brought about an unbearable headache for Muhammad [pbuh]’s followers. Having judged all the prevalent status quo in this perspective and in light of the disgraceful attempt on the life of the Prophet [pbuh], the Muslims made the decisive decision to take up arms whatever consequences could ensue.</p>
<p>When the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] received the reply of Huyai bin Akhtab, he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allâhu Akbar, Allâhu Akbar." (Allâh is the Greatest of all) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And his Companions repeated after him. Then he set out to fight them after appointing Ibn Umm Maktum to dispose of the affairs of Madinah during his absence. The standard was entrusted to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib. He laid siege to their forts for six nights — in another version, fifteen.</p>
<p>Banu Nadeer resorted to their castles, mounted them, and started shooting arrows and pelting stones at the Muslims enjoying the strategic advantage that their thick fields of palm trees provided. The Muslims were therefore ordered to fell and burn those trees. In this respect, Allâh, the All-Mighty, states in the Qur’ân: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What you (O Muslims) cut down of the palm-trees (of the enemy) or you left them standing on their stems, it was by the leave of Allâh." [Al-Qur'an 59:5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Quraizah tribe remained neutral, and the hypocrite ‘Abdullah bin Ubai, along with Ghatfan, failed to keep their promises of support. In this regard, Allâh says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(Their allies deceived them) like Satan, when he says to man: ‘Disbelieve in Allâh.’ But when (man) disbelieves in Allâh, Satan says: ‘I am free of you.’" [Al-Qur'an 59:16]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The siege did not last long as Allâh, the All-Mighty, cast horror into the hearts of the Jews, and they willingly offered to comply with the Prophet [pbuh]’s order and leave Madinah. The Prophet [pbuh] accepted their request and allowed them to carry as much luggage as their camels could lift, arms excepted. Of course, they had no choice but to carry out the orders, so they took with them everything they could carry, even the pegs and beams of ceilings. Their caravan counted 600 loaded camels, including their chiefs, Huyai bin Akhtab and Salam bin Abi Al-Huqaiq, who left for Khaibar, whereas another party shifted to Syria. Two of them embraced Islam, Yameen bin ‘Amr and Abu Sa‘d bin Wahab, and so they retained their personal wealth.</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] seized their weapons, land, houses, and wealth. Among the other booty he managed to capture, there were 50 armours, 50 helmets, and 340 swords.</p>
<p>This booty was exclusively the Prophet [pbuh]’s since no fighting was involved in capturing it. He divided the booty at his own discretion among the early Emigrants and two poor Helpers, Abu Dujana and Suhail bin Haneef. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] spent a portion of this wealth on his family to sustain their living throughout the year. The rest was expended to provide the Muslim army with equipment for further wars in the way of Allâh.</p>
<p>The invasion of Bani An-Nadeer took place in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, 4 A.H., i.e., in August 625 A.D. Almost all the verses of Sûrah Al-Hashr (Chapter 59 - The Gathering) describe the banishment of the Jews and reveal the disgraceful manners of the hypocrites. The verses manifest the rules relevant to the booty. In this Chapter, Allâh, the All-Mighty, praises the Emigrants and Helpers. This Chapter also shows the legitimacy of cutting down and burning the enemy’s land and trees for military purposes. Such acts cannot be regarded as phenomena of corruption as long as they are in the way of Allâh.</p>
<p>In this very Chapter, Allâh recommends the believers to be pious and prepare themselves for the world to come, and He ends it with a compliment upon Himself and a manifestation of His Holy Names and Attributes. As this Chapter concentrates on Bani An-Nadeer and their banishment, Ibn ‘Abbas used to describe it as ‘An-Nadeer Chapter.</p>
<h3>The Invasion of Najd</h3>
<p>With the peaceful victory that the Muslims achieved at Bani An-Nadeer invasion, their control over Madinah was undisputedly established, and the hypocrites receded to a state of silence and stopped their artful machinations publicly. Consequently, the Prophet [pbuh] had ample time to direct all his energies and human resources towards suppressing the desert bedouins and curbing their harmful provocations and wicked malicious practices of killing his missionaries and even contemplating an invasion of Madinah itself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Muslim scouting groups reported the buildup of bedouin troops of Bani Muharib and Tha‘labah of Ghatfan around Madinah. The Prophet [pbuh], with the Muslims, hurriedly set out to discipline those new outlaws, cast fear into their hearts, and deter them from perpetrating further wicked practices. These deterring operations were carried out repeatedly and did produce effective results. The rebellious hard-hearted desert bedouins were terrorized into the mountains, and Madinah remained completely immune against their raids.</p>
<p>In the context of these invasions, it is interesting to draw some prominence to a significant one – the Dhat Ar-Riqa‘ (rags) campaign – which some scholars claim took place in Najd in Rabi‘ Ath-Thani or Jumada Al-Ula, 4 A.H. They substantiate their claim by saying that it was strategically necessary to carry out this campaign to quell the rebellious bedouins to meet the exigencies of the agreed-upon encounter with the polytheists, i.e., the minor Badr Battle in Sha‘ban, 4 A.H. The most authentic opinion, however, is that the Dhat Ar-Riqa‘ campaign took place after the fall of Khaibar. This is supported by the fact that Abu Hurairah and Abu Musa Al-Ash‘ari [R] witnessed the battle. Abu Hurairah embraced Islam only a few days before Khaibar, and Abu Musa Al-Ash‘ari came back from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and joined the Prophet [pbuh] at Khaibar. The rules relating to the prayer of fear which the Prophet [pbuh] observed at the Dhat Ar-Riqa‘ campaign were revealed at the ‘Asfan Invasion and this, beyond a shadow of a doubt, took place after Al-Khandaq (the trench) Battle in late 5 A.H.</p>
<h3>The Invasion of Badr, the Second</h3>
<p>When the Muslims destroyed the power of the Arab desert tribes and guarded themselves against their evils, they started preparations to encounter their great enemy. A year elapsed since they fought Quraish at Uhud. So it was due time to meet them and start war again to determine which of the two parties was worthy of survival.</p>
<p>In Sha‘ban 4 A.H., January 626 A.D., the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] set out to Badr accompanied by one thousand and five hundred fighters and ten mounted horsemen, with ‘Ali bin Abi Talib as standard bearer. ‘Abdullah bin Rawahah was given authority over Madinah during the Prophet [pbuh]’s absence. Reaching Badr, the Muslims stayed there waiting for the idolaters to come.</p>
<p>Abu Sufyan’s forces comprised two thousand footmen and fifty horsemen. They reached Mar Az-Zahran, some distance from Makkah, and camped at a water place called Mijannah. Being reluctant, discouraged, and extremely terrified of the consequences of the approaching fight, Abu Sufyan turned to his people and began to introduce cowardice-based flimsy pretexts to dissuade his men from going to war, saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O tribe of Quraish! Nothing will improve the condition you are in but a fruitful year — a year during which your animals feed on plants and bushes and give you milk to drink. And I see that this is a rainless year, therefore I am returning now, and I recommend you to return with me."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that his army was also possessed of the same fears and apprehensions, for they readily obeyed him without the least hesitation.</p>
<p>The Muslims, who were then at Badr, stayed for eight days waiting for their enemy. They took advantage of their stay by selling goods and earning double the price out of it. When the idolaters declined to fight, the balance of powers shifted in favour of the Muslims, who thus regained their military reputation, their dignity, and managed to impose their awe-inspiring presence over the whole of Arabia. In brief, they mastered and controlled the whole situation.</p>
<p>This invasion had many names. It is called ‘Badr the Appointment’, ‘Badr, the Second’, ‘Badr, the Latter’, and ‘Badr Minor’.</p>
<h3>The Invasion of Doumat Al-Jandal</h3>
<p>With the Messenger [pbuh]’s return from Badr, peace and security prevailed in the whole area; and the Islamic headquarters, Madinah, enjoyed full security. The Prophet [pbuh] then deemed it fit and appropriate to head for the most distant areas of Arabia to subdue all hostile elements in order to force undisputed recognition out of friends and foes alike.</p>
<p>After a six-month lull of military activities, the Prophet [pbuh] was informed that some tribes, in the vicinity of Doumat Al-Jandal, on the borders of Syria, were involved in highway robbery and plundering and were on their way to muster troops and raid Madinah itself. He immediately appointed Siba‘ bin ‘Arfatah Al-Ghifari to dispose of the affairs of Madinah during his absence and set out at the head of 1000 Muslims in late Rabi‘ Al-Awwal, 5 A.H., taking with him a man named Madhkur from Bani ‘Udhrah as a guide.</p>
<p>On their way to Doumat Al-Jandal, they used to march by night and hide by day, so that they might take the enemy by surprise. When they drew near their destination, the Muslims discovered that the highway men had moved to another place, so they captured their cattle and shepherds. The inhabitants of Doumat Al-Jandal had also fled in all directions for their lives and evacuated their habitations. The Prophet [pbuh] stayed there for 5 days during which he dispatched expeditionary forces to hunt for the enemy personnel, but they detected none. He then returned to Madinah; however, en route, he entered into a peace treaty with ‘Uyainah bin Hisn. Doumat Al-Jandal is located about a distance of fifteen days march from Madinah and five from Damascus.</p>
<p>With this decisive and steady progress and wise strict plans, the Prophet [pbuh] managed to spread security, control the situation and make peace prevail in the whole area. He also succeeded in shifting the course of events for the welfare of the Muslims by reducing the incessant internal and external troubles. The hypocrites were silenced, a tribe of the Jews evacuated while the other continued to fake good neighbourliness and seemingly faithful adherence to the covenants, the desert bedouins subdued, and finally, the archenemy Quraish was no longer keen on attacking the Muslims. This secure strategic attitude created optimum circumstances for the Muslims to resume their logical course in propagating Islam and communicating the Messages of the Lord to all worlds.</p>
<h3>Al-Ahzab (The Confederates) Invasion</h3>
<p>Once again, peace and security enveloped the Arabian Peninsula, and this turbulent area began to experience a period of lull after a whole year of war. The Jews, however, whose treachery, intrigues, and disloyalty made them taste all types of humiliation and disgrace, were not admonished. After they had been exiled to Khaibar, they remained waiting anxiously for the results of the skirmishes going on between the Muslims and the idolaters. Contrary to their hopes, the events of the war were in favour of the Muslims, therefore they started a new stage of conspiracy and prepared themselves to deal a deadly blow against the Muslims, but were too cowardly to manoeuvre directly against them, so they laid a dreadful plan to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>Twenty chiefs of the Jews with some celebrities of Bani Nadir went to Makkah to negotiate an unholy alliance with Quraish. They began to goad the people there to attack the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], promising them full support and backing. The people of Quraish, who had been languid and proved too weak to challenge the Muslims at Badr, seized this opportunity to redeem their stained honour and blemished reputation. The same delegation set out for Ghatfan, calling them to do the same, and they responded positively. The Jewish delegation then started a fresh effort and toured some parts of Arabia and managed to incite the confederates of disbelief against the Prophet [pbuh], his Message, and the believers in Allâh. </p>
<p>Quraish, Kinanah, and other allies from Tihama in the south rallied, ranked and recruited four thousand men under the leadership of Abu Sufyan. From the east came tribes of Banu Saleem, Ghatfan, Bani Murrah, etc. They all headed for Madinah and gathered in its vicinity at a time already agreed upon. It was a great army of ten thousand fighters. They, in fact, outnumbered all the Muslims in Madinah, women, lads, and elders included. To tell the truth, if they had launched a surprise attack against Madinah, they could have exterminated all the Muslims. However, the leadership inside the city was alert and the intelligence personnel managed to reconnoitre the area of the enemies and reported their movement to the people in charge in Madinah. </p>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] summoned a high advisory board and conducted a careful discussion of a plan to defend Madinah. After a lengthy talk between military leaders and people possessed of sound advice, it was agreed, on the proposal of an honourable Companion, Salman Al-Farisi, to dig trenches as defensive lines. The Muslims, with the Prophet [pbuh] at their head encouraging, helping, and reminding them of the reward in the Hereafter, most actively and diligently started to build a trench around Madinah. Severe hunger, bordering on starvation, could not dissuade or discourage them from achieving their desperately sought objective. Salman said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Messenger of Allâh! When siege was laid to us in Persia, we used to dig trenches to defend ourselves." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was really an unprecedented wise plan. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] hurriedly gave orders to implement the plan. Forty yards were allocated to each group of ten to dig. Sahl bin Sa‘d said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We were in the company of the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], the men used to dig, and we would evacuate the earth on our backs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some preternatural Prophetic signs appeared in the process of trenching. Jabir bin ‘Abdullah, seeing the Prophet [pbuh] starving, slaughtered a sheep, cooked some barley, and requested the Prophet [pbuh] and some Companions to accept his invitation, but the Prophet [pbuh] gathered all the thousand people engaged in digging the trench, and they started to eat until they were all completely full, and yet the shoulder of mutton and dough that was being baked remained as they were undiminished. A certain woman brought a handful of dates and passed by the Prophet [pbuh], who took the dates, threw them over his cloak, and invited his followers to eat. The dates began to increase in number until they dropped over the trim of his robe. </p>
<p>Another illustrious preternatural example went into effect when an obstinate rock stood out as an immune obstacle in the ditch. The Prophet [pbuh] took the spade and struck, and the rock immediately turned into a loose sand dune. In another version, Al-Bara‘ said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On Al-Khandaq (the trench) Day, there stood out a rock too immune for our spades to break up. We therefore went to see the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] for advice. He took the spade and struck the rock, uttering, 'In the Name of Allâh, Allâh is Great, the keys of Ash-Shâm (Geographical Syria) are mine; I swear by Allâh, I can see its palaces at the moment;' on the second strike, he said: 'Allâh is Great, Persia is mine; I swear by Allâh, I can now see the white palace of Madain;' and for the third time he struck the rock, which turned into very small pieces, he said: 'Allâh is Great, I have been given the keys of Yemen; I swear by Allâh, I can see the gates of San‘a while I am in my place.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The northern part of Madinah was the most vulnerable, all the other sides being surrounded by mountains and palm tree orchards. The Prophet [pbuh], as a skillful military expert, understood that the Confederates would march in that direction, so the trench was ordered to be on that side. The Muslims went on digging the trench for several days; they used to work on it during the day and go back home in the evening until it had assumed its full dimensions militarily before the huge army of the idolaters, which numbered as many as ten thousand fighters, arrived and settled in the vicinity of Madinah in places called Al-Asyal and Uhud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And when the believers saw ‘Al-Ahzab’ (the confederates), they said: ‘This is what Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) had promised us, and Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad [pbuh]) had spoken the truth, and it only added to their Faith and to their submissiveness (to Allâh)." [Al-Quran 33:22]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three thousand Muslims, with Muhammad [pbuh] at their head, came out to encounter the idolaters, with Allâh’s Promise of victory deeply established in their minds. They entrenched themselves in Sila‘ Mountain with the trench standing as a barrier between them and the disbelievers.</p>
<p>On attempting to attack the Muslims and break into Madinah, the idolaters were surprised to see a wide trench, a new stratagem unknown in Arabia before, standing as an obstinate obstruction. Consequently, they decided to lay siege to Madinah and began to manoeuvre around the trench trying hard to find a vulnerable spot through which they could infiltrate into Madinah. To deter their enemies from approaching or bridging any gap in their defences, the Muslims hurled arrows and engaged in skirmishes with them. The veteran fighters of Quraish were averse to this situation, waiting in vain in anticipation of what the siege might reveal. Therefore, they decided that a group of fighters led by ‘Amr bin ‘Abd-e-Wudd, ‘Ikrima bin Abi Jahl, and Dirar bin Al-Khattab, should work their way through the trench. They managed to do that and their horsemen captured a marshy area between the trench and Sila‘ Mountain. ‘Amr challenged the Muslims to a duel, and ‘Ali bin Abi Talib was deputed. After a short but fierce engagement, ‘Ali killed ‘Amr and obliged the others to evacuate in a state of panic and confusion. However, some days later, the polytheists conducted fresh desperate attempts but all of them failed due to the Muslims’ steadfastness and heroic confrontation.</p>
<p>In the context of the events of the Trench Battle, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] failed to observe some prayers in their right time. Jabir [R] narrated: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On the Day of Trench, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab [R] came, cursing the disbelievers of Quraish and said: ‘O Allâh’s Messenger! I have not offered the afternoon prayer and the sun has set.’" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By Allâh! I, too, have not offered the prayer yet." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then went to Buthan, performed ablution, observed the afternoon prayer after the sun had set, and then offered the sunset prayer after it. </p>
<p>He was so indignant for this failure that he invoked Allâh’s wrath on his enemies and besought Allâh to fill their houses and graves with fire because they distracted him from observing the afternoon prayer. It was narrated by Ahmed and Shafa‘i that the events of that battle detained him from the noon, afternoon, evening, and night prayers, but he observed them combined. The different narrations point to the fact that the situation lasted for a few days.</p>
<p>It is clear that, because of the trench standing between the two parties, no direct engagement took place, but rather there were military activities confined to arrow hurling; consequently the fight claimed the lives of a small number of fighters, six Muslims and ten polytheists, one or two killed by sword.</p>
<p>During the process of fighting, Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh was shot by an arrow that pierced his artery. Perceiving his end approaching, he invoked Allâh saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, Allâh, you know nothing is closer to my heart than striving in Your way against those people (disbelievers) who belied Your Messenger and banished him from his town. Oh, Allâh, I deeply believe that You have decreed that we should fight them, so if there is still more fighting to go with them, let me stay alive in order to strive more against them. If it has settled down, I beseech you to ignite it again so that I breathe my last in its context." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He concluded his supplication beseeching Allâh not to let him die until he had had full revenge on Banu Quraiza. In the midst of these difficult circumstances, plottery and intrigues were fervently active against the Muslims. </p>
<p>The chief criminal of Bani Nadir, Huyai, headed for the habitations of Banu Quraiza to incite their chief Ka‘b bin Asad Al-Qurazi, who had drawn a pact with the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to run to his aid in times of war. Ka‘b, in the beginning, resisted all of Huyai’s temptation, but Huyai was clever enough to manipulate him, speaking of Quraish and their notables in Al-Asyal, as well as Ghatfan and their chieftains entrenched in Uhud, all of one mind, determined to exterminate Muhammad [pbuh] and his followers. He promised to stay in Ka‘b’s fort exposing himself to any potential danger in case Quraish and Ghatfan recanted. The wicked man went on in this manner until he later managed to win Ka‘b to his side and persuade him to break his covenant with the Muslims.</p>
<p>Banu Quraiza then started to launch war operations against the Muslims, especially the secluded garrisons that housed the women and children of the Muslims. On the authority of Ibn Ishaq, Safiyah [R], daughter of ‘Abdul Muttalib, happened to be in a garrison with Hassan bin Thabit, as well as some women and children. Safiyah said: “A Jew was spotted lurking around our site, which was vulnerable to any enemy attacks because there were no men to defend it. I informed Hassan that I was suspicious of that man’s presence near us. He might take us by surprise now that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] and the Muslims are too busy to come to our aid, why don’t you get down and kill him? Hassan answered that he would not do it, so I took a bar of wood, went down, and struck the Jew to death. I returned and asked Hassan to loot him, but again Hassan refused.”</p>
<p>This event had a far-reaching effect and discouraged the Jews from conducting further attacks, thinking that those sites were fortified and protected by Muslim fighters. They, however, went on providing the idolaters with supplies in token of their support against the Muslims.</p>
<p>On hearing this bad news, the Messenger [pbuh] despatched four Muslim prominent leaders, Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, Sa‘d bin ‘Ubada, ‘Abdullah bin Rawaha, and Khawat bin Jubair, for investigation but warning against any sort of spreading panic among the Muslims and advising that they should declare in public that the rumours are groundless if they turned out to be so. Unfortunately, the four men discovered that the news was true and that the Jews announced openly that no pact of alliance existed any longer with Muhammad [pbuh]. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] was briefed on this situation, and the Muslims understood their critical position with the horrible danger implied therein. Their back was vulnerable to the attacks of Banu Quraiza, and a huge army faced them from the front, while their women and children remained unprotected standing in between. In this regard, Allâh says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And when the eyes grew wild, and the hearts reached to the throats, and you were harbouring doubts about Allâh. There, the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking." [Al-Qur'an 33:10, 11]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that the Muslims were shut in within the Trench on the defensive, the hypocrites taunted them for having indulged in delusive hopes of defeating Kisra, the emperor of Persia, and Caesar, the emperor of the Romans. They began to sow the seeds of defeatism, pretending to withdraw for the defence of their homes, though these were in no way exposed to danger. Here, Allâh says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubts) said, ‘Allâh and His Messenger ([pbuh]) promised us nothing but delusions!’ And when a party of them said: ‘O people of Yathrib (Al-Madinah), there is no stand (possible) for you (against the enemy attack!) therefore go back!’ And a band of them asked for permission of the Prophet ([pbuh]) saying: ‘Truly, our homes lie open (to the enemy).’ And they lay not open. They but wished to flee." [Al-Qur'an 33:12, 13]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] wrapped himself in his robe and began to meditate on the perfidy of Banu Quraiza. The spirit of hopefulness prevailed over him, and he rose to his feet, saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allâh is Great. Hearken you Muslims, to Allâh’s good tidings of victory and support." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then started to lay decisive plans to protect the women and children and sent some fighters back to Madinah to guard them against any surprise assault by the enemy. The second step was to take action that could undermine the ranks of the disbelieving confederates. There, he had in mind to conclude a sort of reconciliation with the chiefs of Ghatfan on the basis of donating them a third of Madinah’s fruit crops. He sought the advice of his chief Companions, namely, Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh and Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah, whose reply went as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Messenger of Allâh! If it is Allâh’s injunction, then we have to obey, but if it is a new course you want to follow just to provide security for us, then we don’t need it. We experienced those people in polytheism and idolatry, and we can safely say that they don’t need the fruit of our orchards, they rather need to exterminate us completely. Now that Allâh has honoured us with Islam, I believe the best recourse in this situation is to put them to the sword." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon, the Prophet [pbuh] corrected their belief saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My new policy is being forged to provide your security after all the Arabs have united to annihilate you (Muslims)." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allâh, the Glorious, the Exalted, created something that led to the dissension of the enemies of Islam and later on to their full defeat. A man from the tribe of Ghatfan called Na‘im bin Mas‘ud asked to be admitted to the audience of the Prophet [pbuh]. He declared that he had embraced Islam secretly and asked the Prophet [pbuh] to order him to do anything that might benefit the Muslims. The Prophet [pbuh] asked him to do anything that could help the Muslims in the present distress and use any stratagem of avail. The man, in a shuttle movement between the Jews, Quraish, and Ghatfan, managed to incite each party to let down the other. </p>
<p>He went to see the chiefs of Banu Quraiza and whispered in their ears not to trust Quraish nor fight with them unless the latter pledged some hostages. He tried to lend support to his counsel by claiming that Quraish would forsake them if they perceived that victory over Muhammad [pbuh] was far-fetched, and the Muslims then would have terrible revenge on them. Na‘im then headed to the camp of Quraish and managed to practice a similar stratagem in its final result but different in content. He claimed that he felt that the Jews regretted breaching their covenant with Muhammad [pbuh] and his followers. He told them that the Jews maintained regular correspondence with the Muslims to the effect that Quraishite hostages be sent to the camp of the Muslims with full Jewish allegiance paid to them as already agreed upon. Na‘im then exhorted Quraish not to send hostages to the Jews. On a third errand, he did the same with the people of Ghatfan.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, Shawwal, 5 A.H., both Quraish and Ghatfan despatched envoys to the Jews exhorting them to go into war against Muhammad [pbuh]. The Jews sent back messages that they would not fight on Saturday. They added that they needed hostages from them to guarantee their consistency. On receiving the replies, Quraish and Ghatfan came to believe Na‘im’s words fully. Therefore, they sent a message to the Jews again inviting them to war and asking them to preclude that condition of hostages. Na‘im’s scheme proved successful, and a state of distrust and suspicion among the disbelieving allies prevailed, reducing their morale to a deplorable degree.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Muslims were preoccupied supplicating their Lord to protect their homes and provide security for their families. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh], on his part, invoked Allâh’s wrath on the Confederates, supplicating: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, Allâh! You are quick in account; You are the sender of the Book, we beseech You to defeat the confederates." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allâh the Glorious, the Exalted, responded to the call of the Muslims on the spot. Coupled with the dissension and variance that found their way into the hearts of the disbelievers, forces of nature—wind, rain, and cold—wearied them; tents were blown down, cooking vessels and other equipment were overthrown.</p>
<p>That very cold night, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] despatched Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman to hunt around for news about the enemy. He found out that they were preparing to leave frustrated at their inability to achieve their target. Allâh did indeed fulfill His Promise, spared the Muslims fighting a formidable army, supported His slave (Muhammad [pbuh]), and inflicted a heavy blow on the Confederates.</p>
<p>The battle of the Trench took place in the fifth year Hijri. The siege of Madinah started in Shawwal and ended in Dhul Qa‘dah, i.e., it lasted for over a month. It was, in fact, a battle of nerves rather than losses. No bitter fighting was recorded; nevertheless, it was one of the most decisive battles in the early history of Islam and proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that no forces, however huge, could ever exterminate the nascent Islamic power growing steadily in Madinah. When Allâh obliged the Confederates to evacuate, His Messenger was in a position to confidently declare that thenceforth he would take the initiative in war and would not wait for the land of Islam to be invaded.</p>
<h3>Invading Banu Quraiza</h3>
<p>Archangel Gabriel [AWS], on the very day the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] returned to Madinah after the previous battle and while he was washing in Umm Salama’s house, visited him asking that he should unsheathe his sword and head for the habitation of the seditious Banu Quraiza and fight them. Gabriel noted that he and a procession of angels would go ahead to shake their forts and cast fear in their hearts. </p>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] immediately summoned the prayer caller and ordered him to announce fresh hostilities against Banu Quraiza. He instituted Ibn Umm Maktum as a ruler of Madinah and entrusted the banner of war to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, who marched towards the appointed target and came close enough to hear the Jews abusing the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh].</p>
<p>On their way to encounter the enemy, the afternoon prayer was due. Some Muslims refused to observe it until they had defeated the enemy, while others offered it in its proper time, as usual. The Prophet [pbuh] objected to neither. When they reached the habitations of Banu Quraiza, they laid tight siege to their forts. </p>
<p>Seeing this terrible situation, the chief of the Jews, Ka‘b bin Asad, offered them three alternatives: to embrace Islam, and consequently their life, wealth, women, and children would be in full security (reminding them that such behaviour would not be incongruous with what they had read in their books about the veracity of Muhammad’s Prophethood); to kill their children and women and then challenge the Prophet [pbuh] and his followers to the sword to either exterminate the Muslims or be exterminated; or as a third possibility, to take Muhammad [pbuh] and his people by surprise on Saturday—a day mutually understood to witness no fighting.</p>
<p>None of those alternatives appealed to them, so their chief, angrily and indignantly, turned to them saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You have never been decisive in decision-making since you were born!" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gloomy future already visible, they made contacts with some Muslims, who had maintained good relations with them, in order to learn about their fate in light of the current circumstances. They requested that Abu Lubaba be despatched to them for advice. On his arrival, the men began to implore, and women and children cried desperately. In answer to their demand for advice, he pointed to his throat, saying it was homicide awaiting them. He then immediately realized that he had betrayed the Prophet’s trust, so he headed directly for the mosque in Madinah and tied himself to a wooden tall pole, swearing that no one would untie him save the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh]. He added that he would never enter the habitation of Banu Quraiza in recompense for the deadly mistake he made. </p>
<p>When the Messenger [pbuh] was informed of this incident, he said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I would have begged Allâh to forgive him if he had asked me, but since he has tied himself out of his own free will, then it is Allâh Who would turn to him in forgiveness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Jews of Banu Quraiza could have endured the siege much longer because food and water were plentifully available and their strongholds were greatly fortified, whereas the Muslims were in the wild bare land suffering a lot from cold and hunger, not to mention too much fatigue resultant from endless warfare operations that had started even before the battle of the Confederates. Nevertheless, this was a battle of nerves, for Allâh had cast fear in the Jews’ hearts, and their morale had almost collapsed, especially when two Muslim heroes, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib and Az-Zubair bin ‘Awwam [R], proceeded while ‘Ali swore that he would never stop until he had either stormed their garrisons or been martyred like Hamza (a former Muslim martyr).</p>
<p>In light of this reluctance, they had nothing except to comply with the Messenger’s judgement. The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] ordered that the men should be handcuffed, and this was done under the supervision of Muhammad bin Salamah Al-Ansari, while the women and children were isolated in confinement. Thereupon, the Aws tribe interceded, begging the Prophet [pbuh] to be lenient towards them. He suggested that Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh, a former ally, be deputed to give verdict about them, and they agreed.</p>
<p>Sa‘d, meanwhile, stayed behind in Madinah due to a serious wound he sustained in the Confederates Battle. He was summoned and brought on a donkey. On his way to the Prophet [pbuh], the Jews urged him to be lenient in his judgement on account of former friendship. Sa‘d remained silent but when they persisted, he uttered: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is time for Sa‘d not to be afraid of the blame of the blamers." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On hearing this decisive attitude, some of them returned to Madinah waiting for a desperate doom. </p>
<p>On arrival, he alighted with the help of some men. He was informed that the Jews had agreed to accept his verdict about them. He immediately wondered if his judgement would pass on all the people present, including the Prophet [pbuh], turning his face away in honour of him. The reply was positive; he decided that all able-bodied male persons belonging to the tribe should be killed, women and children taken prisoners, and their wealth divided among the Muslim fighters. The Prophet [pbuh] accepted his judgement, saying that Sa‘d had adjudged by the Command of Allâh. </p>
<p>In fact, the Jews deserved that severe punitive action for the ugly treachery they had harboured against Islam and the large arsenal they had amassed, consisting of one thousand and five hundred swords, two thousand spears, three hundred armours, and five hundred shields—all of which went into the hands of the Muslims. Trenches were dug in the bazaar of Madinah, and a number of Jews, between six hundred and seven hundred, were beheaded therein. Hot beds of intrigue and treachery were thus exterminated once and for all. Huyai, a chief criminal of war, a devil of Bani Nadir and Safiyah’s father, had joined the ranks of Banu Quraiza when Quraish and Ghatfan defected, was admitted into the audience of the Prophet [pbuh] with his hands tied to his neck with a rope. </p>
<p>In audacious defiance, he declared obstinate enmity to the Prophet [pbuh] but admitted that Allâh’s Will was to be fulfilled and added that he was resigned to his fate. He was ordered to sit down and was beheaded on the spot. Only one woman of the Jews was killed because she had killed a Muslim warrior by flinging a grinding stone upon him. A few elements of the enemy embraced Islam and their lives, wealth, and children were spared. </p>
<p>As for the spoils of the war, the Prophet [pbuh] divided them after putting a fifth aside, in accordance with Allâh’s injunctions. Three shares went to the horseman and one to the infantry fighter. Women captives were sent to Najd to be bartered for horses and weaponry. For himself, the Prophet [pbuh] selected Rehana bint ‘Amr bin Khanaqah, manumitted, and married her in the year 6 Hijri. She died shortly after the farewell pilgrimage and was buried in Al-Baqi‘.</p>
<p>After the war with Banu Quraiza had been settled and they had been defeated, Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh’s wish was gratified and he gave his last breath. In response to his supplication, ‘Aishah [R] narrated, Sa‘d’s wounds began to bleed from the front part of his neck while he was in his tent, which the Prophet [pbuh] had pitched for him in the mosque so that he would be in close proximity for the Messenger to inquire about and watch his well-being closely. </p>
<p>The people were not scared except when the blood flowed towards them, and in the Mosque along with Sa‘d’s tent, there was the tent of Banu Ghifar. They said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O people of the tent, what is it that is coming to us from you?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lo! it was Sa‘d’s wound that was bleeding and he died there.</p>
<p>Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Throne of the Compassionate shook for the death of Sa‘d bin Mu‘adh." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When his bier was carried, At-Tirmidhi said: "The hypocrites alleged it was too light." The Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] retorted: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The angels are carrying him."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the process of the siege laid to Banu Quraiza, one man of the Muslims, Khallad bin Suwaid, was killed when a woman of the Jews dropped a grinding stone on him, and another, Abu Sinan bin Mihsan, the brother of ‘Ukasha, died.</p>
<p>Abu Lubaba stayed tied for six nights. His wife used to untie him at prayer times and then he tied himself again to the pole. One early morning, Allâh, the All-Forgiving, revealed a verse to the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] to the effect that Allâh had turned to Abu Lubaba with forgiveness. The Muslims rushed to release him, but he insisted that the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] himself do it. This was done shortly before the morning prayer.</p>
<p>This Ghazwah took place in the month of Dhul Qa‘dah in the year five Hijri, and the siege of Banu Quraiza’s forts lasted for 25 days. The Chapter of Confederates was revealed containing Allâh’s Words concerning the basic issues relating to the believers and hypocrites during the battle of the Confederates and the consequences of the treachery and breaching of covenants by the Jews.</p>
<h3>Military Activities Continued</h3>
<p>Salam bin Abi Al-Huqaiq (Abu Rafi‘) was a terrible Jewish criminal who had mustered the troops of the Confederates and provided them with a lot of wealth and supplies, on one hand, while maligning the Prophet [pbuh] on the other. When the Muslims had settled their affair with Banu Quraiza, the Al-Khazraj tribe, a rival of Al-Aws, asked for the Prophet’s permission to kill that criminal in order to merit a virtue equal to that of Al-Aws who had killed another criminal of the Jews, Ka‘b bin Al-Ashraf. The Prophet [pbuh] gave them his permission provided that no women or children be killed.</p>
<p>A group of five people with ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ateeq at their head headed for Khaibar where ‘Abu Rafi‘’s fort was situated. When they approached the place, ‘Abdullah advised his men to stay a little behind while he went ahead, disguised in his cloak as if he had been relieving himself. When the people of the fort went in, the gate-keeper called him to enter, thinking he was one of them. ‘Abdullah went in and lurked inside. He then began to unbolt the doors leading to Salam’s room. There, it was absolutely dark, but he managed to put him to the sword and then leave in safety. On his way back, his leg broke, so he wrapped it up in a band and hid in a secret place until morning when someone stood on the wall and announced the death of Salam bin Abi Al-Huqaiq officially. On hearing the glad news, he left and went to see the Prophet [pbuh], who listened to the whole story and then asked ‘Abdullah to stretch his leg, which he wiped, and the fracture healed on the spot. </p>
<p>In another version, all the group of five participated in killing that enemy of Islam. This incident took place in Dhul Qa‘dah or Dhul Hijjah in the year five Hijri.</p>
<p>Shortly after the conclusion of the battle with the Confederates and Quraiza, the Prophet [pbuh] began to despatch punitive expeditions to force the aggressive tribes and rebellious Arabians to come to peaceful terms with the rising state of Islam. </p>
<p>A platoon of thirty believers under the leadership of Muhammad bin Maslamah was despatched on a military mission in Muharram, the sixth year Hijri, following the two previous battles. It headed for the habitation of the Bani Bakr sept. The Muslims attacked that sept and dispersed them in all directions. Plenty of spoils fell to the lot of the Muslims who returned home with a terrible disbeliever, Thumamah bin Uthal Al-Hanafi, chief of Bani Hanifa, who had gone out by order of Musailama, the Liar, to assassinate the Prophet [pbuh]. The Prophet’s Companions tied him to a pole of the Prophetic Mosque. To a question posed by the Prophet [pbuh], Thumamah would say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you were to kill someone, then you would have to choose one of noble descent, if you were to be gracious, then let it be to a grateful man, and if you were to ask for money, you would have to ask for it from a generous man." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He repeated that three times on three different occasions. On the third time, the Prophet [pbuh] ordered that he should be released. He soon went nearby, washed, and then came back to profess the new faith, addressing the Prophet [pbuh]: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No face had been more awful to me than yours, but now it is the closest to my heart; no religion had ever been more repugnant to me than yours, now it is the dearest in my heart. Now I want to perform the ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage)." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] gave him good tidings and asked him to do that. Upon his arrival in Makkah, the Quraish accused him of apostasy. He denied it and affirmed that he had embraced Islam, and then swore that they would never get a grain from Yamama, a suburban area around Makkah, unless the Prophet [pbuh] would allow it. In fact, he did it and refused to send food supplies to Makkah until the Prophet [pbuh] interceded at the Makkans’ earnest plea.</p>
<h3>Bani Lihyan Invasion</h3>
<p>Bani Lihyan had acted treacherously towards ten of the Prophet’s Companions and hanged them. Their habitation being situated deep in the heart of Hijaz on the borders of Makkah, and due to deep-seated blood-revenge between the Muslims on the one hand, and Quraish and the Arabians on the other, the Prophet [pbuh] deemed it unwise to penetrate deep and come close to the greatest enemy, Quraish. </p>
<p>However, when the power of the allied Confederates collapsed and they began to slacken and resign to the current unfavourable balance of power, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] seized this rare opportunity and decided that it was time to take revenge on Bani Lihyan. He set out in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal or Jumada Al-Ula in the year six Hijri at the head of two hundred Muslim fighters and made a feint heading for Syria, then soon changed route towards Batn Gharran, the scene of his Companions’ tragedy, and invoked Allâh’s mercy on them. News of his march reached Bani Lihyan, who immediately fled to the mountain tops nearby and thus remained out of his reach. On his way back, the Prophet [pbuh] despatched a group of ten horsemen to a place called Kura‘ Al-Ghamim, in the vicinity of the habitation of Quraish in order to indirectly confirm his growing military power. All these skirmishes took fourteen days, after which he left back for home.</p>
<h3>Expeditions and Delegations Continued</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A platoon led by ‘Ukasha bin Al-Mihsan was despatched to a place called Al-Ghamir inhabited by Bani Asad in the year six Hijri. The enemy immediately fled leaving behind two hundred camels which were taken to Madinah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A platoon led by Muhammad bin Maslamah set out towards the habitation of Bani Tha‘labah at Dhil Qassa. But a hundred men of the enemies ambushed and killed all of them except Muhammad bin Maslamah, who managed to escape but was badly wounded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In retaliation against Bani Tha‘labah, Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah, at the head of forty men, was despatched to Dhil Qassa. They walked that night and took the enemy by surprise in the morning. Again, they fled to the mountains except one who was injured and later embraced Islam. A lot of booty fell to their lot in that particular incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A platoon, under the leadership of Zaid bin Haritha, was sent to Al-Jumum, the habitation of Bani Saleem, in the same year. A woman from Bani Muzaina showed them the way to the enemy’s camp. There, the Muslims took some captives and gained a lot of booty. Later on, the Messenger of Allâh [pbuh] granted the woman her freedom and married her to one of his followers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zaid bin Haritha, in Jumada Al-Ula 6 Hijri, at the head of a hundred and seventy horsemen, set out to a place called Al-‘Ais, intercepted a caravan of Quraish led by Abul-‘As, the Prophet’s relative, and looted their camels. Abul-‘As escaped and took refuge in Zainab’s (his wife and the Prophet’s daughter) house. He begged her to ask the Prophet [pbuh] for the restitution of his wealth. The Prophet [pbuh] recommended, but without coercion, that the people do that. They immediately gave the man back all his wealth. He went back to Makkah, gave over the trusts to those entitled to them, embraced Islam, and emigrated to Madinah, where the Prophet [pbuh] reunited him with his wife, Zainab, after three and a half years of their first marriage contract. The verse relating to prohibition of marriage between Muslim women and disbelievers had not been revealed then.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Jumada Ath-Thania, the same year, Zaid, at the head of fifteen men, raided Bani Tha‘labah and captured twenty of their camels, but the people had fled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Rajab of the same year, Zaid, at the head of twelve men, set out to a place called Wadi Al-Qura in a reconnaissance mission to explore the movements of the enemy. The people there attacked the Muslims, killed nine of them, while the rest including Zaid bin Haritha managed to escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The invasion of Al-Khabt (diluted yoghurt) took place in the year eight Hijri i.e., before Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty. Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah led three hundred horsemen to observe a caravan belonging to Quraish. Because of the inadequacy of food supplies, they began to starve so much that they had Khabt (diluted yoghurt), hence the appellation "The Army of Al-Khabt". One of the men slaughtered nine camels at three times, three each time at different stages of the mission. Abu ‘Ubaidah, the leader of the campaign prohibited him from doing so. The sea was generous and presented them with an animal called Al-‘Anbar (sperm-whale), so rich in fat that they subsisted on it for half a month. When they came back home, they narrated the story to the Prophet [pbuh], who commented that it was provision granted by Allâh, and asked them to share with him some of its meat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This campaign came chronologically prior to Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty because of and after which the Muslims stopped intercepting Quraishi caravans.</p><p><a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_8">Previous</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/index.html">Index</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_10">Next</a></p></body>
