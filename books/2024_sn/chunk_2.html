<p>Five years before the beginning of his prophethood, a significant event unfolded involving the Ka‘bah in Makkah. The structure suffered damage due to a great flood, prompting the Quraish tribe to reconstruct it. They decided to use only lawful funds for this purpose, shunning money obtained from immoral activities such as usury and prostitution. Despite initial hesitance, the reconstruction began, with each tribe contributing to rebuilding sections of the Ka‘bah. The rebuilding process almost led to conflict over who would have the honor of placing the sacred Black Stone in its original position. To resolve this, the eldest chief proposed that the next person entering the mosque decide the matter, which happened to be Muhammad (peace be upon him). Known for his wisdom and fairness, he proposed a solution that involved all clans, successfully avoiding discord.</p>
<p>Throughout his youth, Muhammad (peace be upon him) demonstrated qualities of modesty, virtuous behavior, and a striking sense of integrity that earned him the title of Al-‘Ameen (the trustworthy). He was deeply reflective, often engaging in contemplation and showing distaste for idolatrous practices prevalent in Makkah. Despite the pervasive superstition and idolatry, he abstained from such engagements, preferring solitude and reflection. His manner and conduct were esteemed by all, including his future wife Khadijah, who would later recount his attributes of maintaining familial ties, assisting the needy, and enduring life’s hardships with grace and truthfulness.</p>
<p>At nearly forty years old, Muhammad (peace be upon him) began spending extensive periods in solitary meditation in the cave of Hira’. It was during these retreats that he pondered over creation and the moral decline of his people. This practice served as a preparatory phase for his forthcoming role as a prophet. Following the initial revelation, a brief pause ensued that tested his patience. However, this period served to strengthen his resolve and longing for divine guidance. Upon resumption, the revelation became frequent and consistent, imparting messages with potential for transformative impact. This laid the foundation for the subsequent phases of his mission: the secret call, followed by public proclamation in Makkah, ultimately expanding beyond, leading to a reshaping of spiritual and social paradigms.</p>
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<h2>Stages of Revelation</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Fifth Revelation</strong>: The Prophet (pbuh) saw the angel in his actual form, who revealed to him what Allah had ordered him to reveal. This is mentioned in the Quran in Surah An-Najm (Chapter 53 - The Star), which occurred twice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Sixth Revelation</strong>: What Allah Himself revealed to him in heaven, i.e., when he ascended to heaven and received Allah’s command for Salah (prayer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Seventh Revelation</strong>: Allah’s Words to His Messenger (pbuh) without the mediation of an angel, a privilege granted to Moses (Musa).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This is clearly attested in the Quran, as it is attested to our Prophet (pbuh) in Surah Al-Isra (Chapter 17 - The Journey by Night).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some religious scholars added a controversial eighth stage in which they state that Allah spoke to the Prophet (pbuh) directly without a curtain between.</p>
<h3>Proclaiming Allah, the All-High, and the Immediate Constituents</h3>
<p>The first revelation sent to the Prophet (pbuh) implied several injunctions, simple in form but highly effective and with serious far-reaching ramifications. The angel communicated to him a manifest message saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) enveloped (in garments)! Arise and warn! And your Lord (Allah) magnify! And your garments purify! And keep away from Ar-Rujz (the idols). And give not a thing in order to have more (or consider not your deeds of Allah’s obedience as a favor to Allah). And be patient for the sake of your Lord (i.e. perform your duty to Allah)!" [Al-Qur'an 74:1-7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For convenience and ease of understanding, we will segment the message into its immediate constituents:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The ultimate objective of warning is to ensure that no one breaching the pleasures of Allah in the entire universe is ignorant of the serious consequences of their behavior and to create a sort of unprecedented shock within their minds and hearts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Magnifying the Lord" explicitly dictates that the only pride allowed on earth is exclusively Allah's, to the exclusion of all others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Cleansing the garments and shunning all aspects of abomination" points to the indispensable need to render both the exterior and interior exceptionally chaste and pure. Additionally, this entails sanctifying the soul against the different sorts of impurities and various pollutants. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) must not regard his strife in the way of Allah as a deed of grace that entitles him to a great reward. Instead, he must exert himself to the utmost, dedicating all efforts and being ready to offer all sacrifices, enveloped by an ever-present awareness of Allah without the least sense of pride in his deeds or sacrifices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last verse revealed to the Prophet (pbuh) alludes to the hostile attitude of the disbelievers, who will jeer at him and his followers. They are expected to disparage him and elevate their malice to the point of scheming against his life and the lives of all believers around him. In this case, he must be patient, persevering, and displaying the highest degree of stamina.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These were the basic preliminaries that the Prophet (pbuh) had to observe—very simple injunctions in appearance, but highly effective in practice. They constituted the trigger that aroused widespread discontent in many corners of the world.</p>
<p>The verses comprise the constituents of the new call and propagation of the new faith. A warning logically implies that there are malpractices with painful consequences sustained by the perpetrators, and since the present life is not necessarily the only room to bring people to account for their misdeeds, the warning necessarily implies calling people to account on another day, i.e., the Day of Resurrection, which suggests the existence of a life beyond this one. </p>
<p>All the verses of the Noble Qur’an call people to testify explicitly to the Oneness of Allah, delegate all their affairs to Allah, the All-High, and subordinate the desires of themselves and the desires of Allah’s servants to attain His Pleasure. The constituents of the call to Islam can briefly be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>A. Testimony to the Oneness of Allah.<br />
B. Belief in the Hereafter.<br />
C. Sanctifying one’s soul and elevating it high above evils and abominations alongside the dire need for virtues and perfect manners, coupled with habituating oneself to righteous deeds.<br />
D. Committing all affairs to Allah, the All-High.<br />
E. All the foregoing should run as a natural corollary to unwavering belief in Muhammad’s Message and compliance with his noble leadership and righteous guidance.</p>
<h3>The Call to Action</h3>
<p>The verses of the Quran, prefaced in the voice of the Most High, mandate the Prophet (pbuh) to undertake this daunting responsibility (calling people unto Allah). The verses extract him forcibly out of his sleep, divest him of his mantle, and detach him from warmth and quiet of life. They drive him down a new course fraught with hardships and requiring great effort in the way of Allah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) enveloped (in garments)! Arise and warn." [Al-Qur'an 74:1-2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests that living for oneself is easy, but it has been decided that he must shoulder this heavy burden; thus, sleep, comfort, or warm bed are deemed alien in his lexicon of life. </p>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) managed to rise to his feet and meet the new task with complete selflessness. He relentlessly strove for over twenty years, never wavering in carrying the burden of this Trust—the role of enlightening mankind and the weight of the new faith. </p>
<h2>Phases and Stages of the Call</h2>
<p>The Muhammadan call could be divided into two distinct phases:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Makkan Phase</strong>: Nearly thirteen years.  </li>
<li><strong>The Madinese Phase</strong>: Fully ten years. </li>
</ol>
<p>Each phase includes distinctive features that can be discerned through an accurate examination of the circumstances that characterized each:</p>
<h3>The Makkan Phase</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three Stages</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Stage of the Secret Call</strong>: Three years.  </li>
<li><strong>Proclamation of the Call in Makkah</strong>: From the beginning of the fourth year of Prophethood to almost the end of the tenth year.  </li>
<li><strong>Call to Islam and Propagating Beyond Makkah</strong>: From the end of the tenth year of Prophethood until Muhammad’s (pbuh) emigration to Madinah.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Madinese phase will be discussed later.</p>
<h3>The First Stage: Strife in the Way of the Call</h3>
<p><strong>Three Years of Secret Call</strong><br />
Makkah was the center for the Arabs and housed the custodians of Al-Ka‘bah. The guardianship of the idols and stone images venerated by all the Arabs lay in the hands of the Makkans. Therefore, reforming and rectifying the situation in a place considered a den of idolatry was challenging. Working in such an environment required unwavering will and determination; hence the call unto Islam assumed a clandestine form to prevent enraging the Makkans.</p>
<p><strong>The Early Converts</strong><br />
The Prophet (pbuh) naturally initiated his sacred mission from home and then moved to people closely associated with him. He called upon those whom he thought would attest to the truth that his Lord had brought. Many people, who nursed not the least seed of doubt regarding the Prophet (pbuh), immediately responded and embraced the true faith.</p>
<p>Khadijah, the Prophet’s wife, was the first to enter the fold of Islam, followed by his freed slave Zaid bin Harithah, his cousin ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, and his intimate friend Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (Abu Bakr the truth verifier). All these individuals professed Islam on the very first day of the call.</p>
<p>Abu Bakr proved to be an energetic and zealous activist. He was wealthy, obliging, mild, and upright, drawing people to his home for knowledge, friendship, pleasant company, and business. He invited those he trusted to Islam, and through his personal efforts, many converted to Islam, including ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan, Az-Zubair bin ‘Awwam, ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf, Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas, and others. These men were the forerunners of the new faith in Arabia and represented various tribes of Quraish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ibn Hisham, a biographer, noted that he counted them to be more than forty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Ishaq said: "Then people entered the fold of Islam in droves, men and women alike, and the new faith could no longer be kept secret." </p>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) used to meet and teach the new converts in privacy since the call to Islam was still running on an individual and secret basis. Revelation accelerated after the first verses, with the verses revealed during this time being short with compelling pauses, in full harmony with the delicate whispering setting. The central theme focused on sanctifying the soul and discouraging the Muslims from falling prey to the deceptive glamour of life. The initial verses also deeply described Hell and Paradise, leading believers down a path that diverged sharply from the ill practices of their compatriots. </p>
<h3>The Establishment of Salah (Prayer)</h3>
<p>Muqatil bin Sulaiman reported that Salah was established as an obligatory ritual at an early stage of the Islamic Call, a two rak‘ah (unit of prayer) Salah in the morning and the same in the evening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And glorify the praises of your Lord in the ‘Ashi (the time period after mid-noon till sunset) and in the Ibkar (the period from early morning or sunrise till before mid-noon)." [Al-Qur'an 40:55]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ibn Hijr noted that while the Prophet (pbuh) prayed before "The Night Journey," there remains controversy over whether the prayer was obligatory before imposing the rules of the usual five prayers a day. </p>
<p>It is reported that when the Prophet (pbuh) received the first Revelation, Gabriel taught him how to perform Wudu (ablution). When the Prophet (pbuh) finished, he took a handful of water and sprinkled it on his loins.</p>
<p>When it was time for prayers, the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and his Companions would go into a mountain valley to pray secretly. </p>
<p>Abu Talib once saw the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and Ali praying. When he learned that it was obligatory prayer, he encouraged them to be constant in their practice.</p>
<h3>Quraish Learns About the Call</h3>
<p>Even though this stage of the Call was clandestine and individual, its news leaked out and piqued public interest throughout Makkah. Initially, the Makkan leaders did not care much about Muhammad (pbuh) and ignored his teachings, perceiving him as merely a religious philosopher like others who speculated on godship and religious obligations. However, this indifference soon shifted to apprehension as the polytheists began to closely monitor Muhammad’s movements, fearing the spread of his Call and the consequent change in their long-held beliefs. </p>
<p>For three underground years of activism, a distinct group of believers emerged, characterized by fraternity and cooperation centered on the promotion and establishment of the call to Islam. After three years, Muhammad (pbuh) felt that the time had come to preach the faith openly. The angel Gabriel conveyed further Revelation of Allah’s Will, commanding him to confront his people, invalidate their falsehoods, and crush their idolatrous practices.</p>
<h3>The Second Phase: Open Preaching</h3>
<p><strong>First Revelation Regarding the Preaching</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad [pbuh]) of near kindred." [Al-Qur'an 26:214]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the first revelation concerning public warning and is included in Surah Ash-Shu‘ara (Chapter 26 – The Poets), which narrates the story of Moses (Musa) from his early days of Prophethood through his conflicts with Pharaoh.</p>
<p>Chronologically, this Chapter belongs to the middle Makkan period, showcasing the resistance the light of Prophecy encountered from the culturally ingrained pagan Makkans. The message it conveys is succinct: while the spirit of Prophecy met opposition from the votaries of evil, the Truth remains unwavering, while falsehood is bound to perish.</p>
<h3>Calling the Closest Kin</h3>
<p>Following Allah’s Commands, Muhammad (pbuh) summoned his kinsmen of Bani Hashim, gathering an audience of forty-five men. </p>
<p>Abu Lahab immediately addressed the Prophet (pbuh), warning him of the impracticality of their position against the tribes of Makkah and questioned the effectiveness of his mission. The Prophet (pbuh) remained silent during this session.</p>
<p>He soon organized another meeting, where he delivered a short speech detailing the stakes involved:</p>
<p>"I celebrate Allah’s praise, I seek His help, I believe in Him, I put my trust in Him, I bear witness that there is no god to be worshipped but Allah with no associate. A guide can never lie to his people. I swear by Allah, there is no god but He, that I have been sent as a Messenger to you, in particular, and to all the people, in general. I swear you will die just as you sleep; you will be resurrected just as you wake up and called to account for your deeds. It will then be either Hell forever or the Garden (Paradise) forever."</p>
<h3>Abu Talib's Support and Mount As-Safa</h3>
<p>Abu Talib expressed his willingness to support the Prophet (pbuh), though he could not abandon the religion of ‘Abdul-Muttalib. </p>
<p>Following this assurance, the Prophet (pbuh) openly called on the people from Mount As-Safa, urging them to testify to the Oneness of Allah and believe in his Messengership and the Day of Resurrection. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Al-Bukhari reported part of this story through Ibn ‘Abbas (R) and mentioned the verses:</p>
<p>"And warn your tribe (O Muhammad [pbuh]) of near kindred." [Al-Qur'an 26:214]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The messenger gathered the people of Quraish, invoking their attention by asking, "O Bani Fahr! O Bani ‘Adi!" Many gathered around, while Abu Lahab was also present. The Prophet (pbuh) inquired: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If I were to tell you that there are horsemen in the valley planning to raid you, would you believe me?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They affirmed that they had never known him to lie. He continued, "I am a warner to you before severe torment." </p>
<p>Abu Lahab responded angrily, "Perish you all the day! Have you summoned us for such a thing?" At this moment, the following verses were revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Perish the two hands of Abi Lahab..." [Al-Qur'an 111:1].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muslim recorded another aspect of the story from Abu Hurairah (R), noting how the Messenger (pbuh) called out the Qurishites to rescue themselves from Fire, emphasizing that relationship alone was no protection against Allah.</p>
<h3>Shouting the Truth and the Polytheists’ Reaction</h3>
<p>The Prophet’s call echoed through Makkah until Allah revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Therefore proclaim openly (Allah’s Message — Islamic Monotheism), that which you are commanded, and turn away from Al-Mushrikun (polytheists)." [Al-Qur'an 15:94]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He began discrediting the superstitions and idolatrous practices of his people, illustrating their intangible realities and proving that idolatry was manifest falsehood. </p>
<p>The Makkans erupted in outrage and disapproval; Muhammad’s (pbuh) declarations disrupted the ideological life they clung to. They quickly rallied their resources to quell the ongoing revolution that challenged their doctrines and heritage. </p>
<p>The polytheists felt that denying Lordship to anyone but Allah would end their claim to authority, causing them to refrain from their injustices against those they previously deemed weak.</p>
<h2>Attempts to Deter Islam's Spread</h2>
<p>As the Call to Islam gained momentum, the polytheists resorted to various strategies to halt its escalation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mockery and Ridicule</strong>: They scoffed, belittled, and laughed at the new converts, attempting to instill despair and weaken their morale.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"And they say: O you (Muhammad [pbuh]) to whom the Dhikr (the Qur'an) has been sent down! Verily, you are a madman." [Al-Qur'an 15:6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They branded the Prophet (pbuh) as insane and his teachings as sorcery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And they wonder that a warner (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) has come to them from among themselves! And the disbelievers say: 'This (Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) is a sorcerer, a liar.'" [Al-Qur'an 38:4]</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Distorting Teachings</strong>: They created ambiguities around the Prophet’s messages, propagating false narratives concerning his character to discredit him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contrasting the Qur’an</strong>: They attempted to distract attention from Allah’s Words by comparing the Qur’an unfavorably with ancient mythology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Urging Compromise</strong>: The polytheists proposed that Muhammad (pbuh) could soften his teachings in exchange for their acceptance of his religion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so they (too) would compromise with you." [Al-Qur'an 68:9].</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Plotting Violence</strong>: Recognizing the futility of other tactics, they advanced plans to assassinate the Prophet (pbuh), as his uncle Abu Talib’s support was the only barrier from violence.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The struggle of Muhammad (pbuh) and his followers during the early years of Islam foreground the rich tapestry of faith and resilience that characterized the nascent Muslim community. The trials faced wouldn't deter them—instead, they solidified their commitment, setting the stage for the spread of Islam that would transform social and spiritual paradigms across the world.</p><p><a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_1">Previous</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/index.html">Index</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_3">Next</a></p></body>
