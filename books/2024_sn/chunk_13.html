<p>The text describes a particular period in the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) following the Battle of Hunain and the subsequent Ta’if campaign. After emerging victorious at Hunain, where believers received divine support against the disbelievers, parts of the enemy forces retreated to Ta’if. The Prophet, peace be upon him, and his companions pursued the retreating forces, thereby collecting significant amounts of booty and taking captives. This successful military engagement not only increased the material resources of the Muslims but also demonstrated the comprehensive compassion of the Prophet, peace be upon him, as seen in his respectful treatment and eventual release of his foster sister, As-Shaimâ’. </p>
<p>The Prophet’s strategic choices during the Ta’if campaign, including placing the siege for an appropriate period before deciding to lift it based on wise counsel, emphasize his diplomatic and military acumen, ultimately ensuring minimal Muslim casualties.</p>
<p>The subsequent distribution of the booty presented challenges concerning fairness and community relations. The Prophet, peace be upon him, utilized the distribution to stabilize relations with recent converts from Makkah and the tribes of Arabia, who received significant shares. This approach, grounded in pragmatism, aimed at securing the loyalty and consolidation of the new Muslim community. The discontent among the Ansar, who received lesser material gains, was addressed by the Prophet, peace be upon him, by highlighting their invaluable spiritual and communal ties with him. His heartfelt discourse affirmed their pivotal role and the honor of their companionship, which ultimately re-established unity and satisfaction among the Ansar, showcasing his emotional intelligence and leadership in healing divisions.</p>
<p>Finally, the text outlines the Prophet’s strategic management following these campaigns, including dispatching delegates and preachers to different tribal regions of Arabia to call towards Islam and ensure peace. The engagements with different tribes, notably the sending of several military platoons, reflect his proactive approach in establishing Islamic governance and security throughout the region. These military and diplomatic efforts were complemented by the circulation of envoys, such as ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, who played crucial roles in breaking idols and resolving conflicts with tribes, thus fostering the spread and stabilization of Islam. The efficient and strategic execution of these missions underscores the Prophet's role as a statesman alongside his spiritual mission, further consolidating the Islamic state during this transformative period.</p>
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<h2>Arrival of the Hawazin Delegation</h2>
<p>The Hawazin delegation arrived at Al-Ji‘ranah just after the distribution of spoils. They were fourteen men headed by Zuhair bin Sard. The Messenger’s foster uncle was one of them. They asked him to bestow upon them some of the wealth and spoils. They uttered so touching words that the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] said to them: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You surely see who are with me. The most desirable speech to me is the most truthful. Which is dearer to you, your wealth or your women and children?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nothing whatsoever compares with kinship." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he performed the noon prayer, they stood up and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We intercede with the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] to exhort the believers, and we intercede with the believers to exhort the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] to forego the captives of our people fallen to their lot." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] performed the noon prayer, they stood up and said what they had been told to say. The Messenger [pbuh], then, said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As for what belongs to me and to the children of Abdul Muttalib, you may consider them, from now on, yours. And I will ask my folksmen to give back theirs." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon hearing that the Emigrants and the Helpers said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What belongs to us is, from now on, offered to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh]." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Al-Aqra‘ bin Habis said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We will grant none of what belongs to me and to Bani Tamim," </p>
</blockquote>
<p>as did ‘Uyaina bin Hisn, who said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As for me and Bani Fazarah, I say ‘No’." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-‘Abbas bin Mirdas also refused and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No" for Bani Saleem and him. His people, however, said otherwise: </p>
<p>"Whatever spoils belong to us we offer to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh]." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"You have undermined my position," said Al-‘Abbas bin Mirdas spontaneously. Then the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These people have come to you as Muslims. For this I have already tarried the distribution of the booty. Besides, I have granted them a fair option but they refused to have anything other than their women and children. Therefore he who has some of theirs and will prefer willingly to give them back, let them do. But those who favor to keep what he owns to himself, let them grant them back too, and he will be given as a recompense six times as much from the first booty that Allah may provide us." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>People then said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We will willingly offer them all for the sake of the Messenger of Allah." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But in this way we are not able to find out who is content and who is not. So go back and we will be waiting for your chiefs to convey to us your decisions." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of them gave back the women and children. The only one who refused to comply with the Messenger’s desire was ‘Uyaina bin Hisn. He initially refused to let an old woman of theirs go back but later on he let her go back. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] gave every captive a garment as a gift.</p>
<h2>Lesser Pilgrimage (Al-‘Umrah) to Makkah and Leaving for Madinah</h2>
<p>Having accomplished the distribution of the spoils at Al-Ji‘ranah, he left while wearing Al-‘Umrah clothes and proceeded to Makkah to perform Al-‘Umrah. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] turned back from there to Madinah after appointing ‘Itab bin Usaid on Makkah as governor. His arrival to Madinah was by the last six nights of Dhul-Qa‘dah, in the year 8 A.H. </p>
<p>On this occasion, Muhammad Al-Ghazali said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What a great change it is between the victorious period of Muhammad at present which Allah has towered with a manifest conquest, and that period of the past during which Muhammad first arrived at this town, eight years ago." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he first came to Madinah, he was pursued and wanted. He was seeking a secure shelter. He was a lonely stranger who sought companionship and comfort. The people of Madinah welcomed him, gave him residence, aided him, and embraced the light of Islam, which had been sent down upon him. They, for his sake, did not care about the enmity of other peoples. Here he is entering Madinah again, after the lapse of eight years of that first visit. Madinah, the town that had received him once, when he was a frightened Emigrant; it receives him once again when Makkah has become in his hands and at his disposal. It is Makkah that has got rid of its pride and Jahiliyah (i.e. pre-Islamic period and traditions). It is now proud again and mighty in Islam. The Messenger of Allah forgave all the errors and wrongs of its people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Verily, he who fears Allah with obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allah makes not the reward of the good-doers to be lost." [Al-Qur'an 12:90]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Missions and Platoons After the Conquest</h2>
<p>Upon returning from this long successful travel, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] stayed in Madinah where he received delegates and dispatched agents and appointed preachers and callers to Islam everywhere. Those whose hearts were still full of prejudice against Islam and therefore were too proud to embrace Allah’s religion, were decisively muffled on their non-acquiescence in the status quo prevalent then in Arabia.</p>
<p>Here is a mini-image of the believed ones. The Messenger’s arrival in Madinah was by the last days of the eighth year of Al-Hijra. No sooner the crescent of Muharram of the ninth year turned up than the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] dispatched the believers to the tribes as shown in the list below: </p>
<ol>
<li>‘Uyaina bin Hisn to Bani Tamim. </li>
<li>Yazeed bin Husain to Aslam and Ghifar. </li>
<li>‘Abbad bin Bishr Al-Ashhali to Sulaim and Muzainah. </li>
<li>Rafi‘ bin Mukaith to Juhainah. </li>
<li>‘Amr bin Al-‘As to Bani Fazarah. </li>
<li>Ad-Dahhak bin Sufyan to Bani Kilab. </li>
<li>Basheer bin Sufyan to Bani Ka‘b. </li>
<li>Ibn Al-Lutabiyah Al-Azdi to Bani Dhubyan. </li>
<li>Al-Muhajir bin Abi Omaiyah to Sana‘a’ (Al-Aswad Al-‘Ansi called at him when he was in it). </li>
<li>Ziyad bin Labid to Hadramout. </li>
<li>‘Adi bin Hatim to Tai’ and Bani Asad. </li>
<li>Malik bin Nuwairah to Bani Hanzalah. </li>
<li>Az-Zabraqan bin Badr to Bani Sa‘d (a portion of them). </li>
<li>Qais bin ‘Asim to Bani Sa‘d (a portion of them). </li>
<li>Al-‘Alâ’ bin Al-Hadrami to Al-Bahrain. </li>
<li>‘Ali bin Abi Talib to Najran (to collect Sadaqa &amp; Jizya). </li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these agents were dispatched in Muharram, others were sent later until the tribes they were heading for had completely converted to Islam. Such a move clearly demonstrates the great success that the Islamic Da‘wah (Call) enjoyed after the Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty. However, shortly after the conquest of Makkah, people began to embrace Islam in large hosts.</p>
<h2>The Platoons</h2>
<p>In the same way that the believed ones were dispatched to the tribes, we understand that dispatching some more platoons to all regions of Arabia is a necessity for the prevalence and domination of security on all lands of Arabia. Here is a list of those platoons:</p>
<ol>
<li>‘Uyaina bin Hisn Al-Fazari’s platoon in Al-Muharram, the ninth year of Al-Hijra to Bani Tamim. It consisted of fifty horsemen, none of them was an Emigrant or a Helper. This expedition was dispatched due to the fact that Bani Tamim had urged other tribes not to pay tribute (Al-Jizya) and eventually stopped them from paying it. Therefore, ‘Uyaina bin Hisn set out to fight them. All the way long he marched by night and lurked by day. He marched until he overtook them and attacked them in the desert. They fled back for their lives. Eleven men, twenty-one women and thirty boys were captured then. He drove them back to Madinah and housed them in Ramlah bint Al-Harith’s residence. Ten of their leaders, who came to the Prophet’s door, called out unto him saying: </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Muhammad, come out and face us." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he went out, they held him and started talking. He exchanged talk with them for a while then left them and went to perform the noon prayer. After prayer, he sat in the mosque-patio. They proclaimed a desire to show boasting and self-pride. For this purpose, they introduced their orator ‘Utarid bin Hajib who delivered his speech. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] asked Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas — the Muslim orator — to respond. He did that. In return, they brought forth their poet Az-Zabraqan bin Badr who recited some boastful poetry. Hassan bin Thabit, the poet of Islam, promptly replied back. When talks and poetry came to an end, Al-Aqra‘ bin Habis said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Their orator is more eloquent than ours, and their poet is more poetically learned than ours. Their voices and sayings excel ours, as well." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, they announced their embracing Islam. Consequently, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] acknowledged their Islamization, awarded them well, and rendered them back their women and children.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A platoon headed by Qutbah bin ‘Amir to a spot called Khath‘am in Tabalah, a plot of land not far from Turbah. That was in Safar, 9 A.H. Accompanied by twenty men and only ten camels to mount alternatively on, Qutbah raided them and fought so fiercely that a great number of both parties were wounded and some others were killed. The Muslims drove back with them camels, women and sheep to Madinah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mission of Dahhak bin Sufyan Al-Kilabi to Bani Kilab in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal in the year 9 A.H. This mission was sent to Bani Kilab to call them to embrace Islam. Refusing to embrace Islam, they started to fight against the Muslims but were defeated and sustained one man killed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The three hundred men expedition of ‘Alqamah bin Mujazziz Al-Mudlaji to Jeddah shores in Rabi‘ Al-Akhir. This expedition was dispatched to fight against some men from Al-Habasha (Ethiopia), who gathered together near the shores of Jeddah and practiced acts of piracy against the Makkans. Therefore, he crossed the sea till he got to an island. But as soon as the pirates learned of the Muslims’ arrival, they fled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task of the platoon of ‘Ali bin Abi Talib was to demolish Al-Qullus, which was an idol that belonged to the Tai’ tribe. That was in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal in the year 9 A.H. ‘Ali was dispatched by the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] with one hundred fifty men. A hundred of them were on camels, while the other fifty were on horseback. He held a black flag and a white banner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At dawn, they raided Mahallat Hatim, demolished the idol, and filled their hands with spoils: camels and sheep booty, whereas ‘Adi fled to Ash-Sham. The sister of ‘Adi bin Hatim was one of the captives. Inside Al-Qullus safe, Muslims found three swords and three armours. On the way, they distributed the spoils and set aside the best things for the Messenger of Allah [pbuh]. They did not share the Hatims.</p>
<p>Upon arrival in Madinah, the sister of ‘Adi bin Hatim begged the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] to have mercy on her and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Messenger of Allah, my brother is absent and my father is dead, and I am too old to render any service. Be beneficent to me so that Allah may be bountiful to you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who is your brother?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is ‘Adi bin Hatim." </p>
<p>"Is he not the one who fled from Allah and His Messenger?" said the Prophet [pbuh] then went away from her. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next day, she reiterated her plea, and the same answer was given. A day later she uttered similar words, and this time he made benefaction to her. The man who was beside the Prophet, and whom she thought to be ‘Ali, said to her: "Ask for an animal from him to ride on." And she was granted her request.</p>
<p>She returned to Ash-Sham where she met her brother and said to him: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] has done me such a noble deed that your father would never have done it. Therefore, willy-nilly, frightened or secure, you should go and see him." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unsecure, neither protected by someone, nor even recommended by a letter as a means of protection, ‘Adi came and met the Prophet. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] took him home with him. As soon as he sat before him, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] thanked Allah and praised Him, then said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What makes you flee? Do you flee lest you should say there is no god but Allah? Do you know any other god but Allah?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"No," he said, then talked for a while. The Messenger of Allah went on saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Certainly you flee so that you may not hear the statement saying ‘Allah is the Greatest.’ Do you know anyone who is greater than Allah?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"No," he said. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Jews are those whose portion is wrath, and the Christians are those who have gone astray," the Prophet retorted. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I am a Muslim and I believe in one God (Allah)," ‘Adi finally proclaimed with a joyous face. The Prophet ordered him a residence with one of the Helpers. From that time he started calling at the Prophet [pbuh] in the mornings and in the evenings.</p>
<p>On the authority of Ibn Ishaq, when the Prophet [pbuh] made him sit down in front of him in his house, the Prophet said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O ‘Adi, were you not cast in disbelief?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yes," ‘Adi said. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Did you not share one quarter of your people’s gains?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yes," said ‘Adi. </p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is sinful in your religion to do such a thing, and you should not allow yourself to do it." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yes, by Allah, that is true," said ‘Adi. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thus I worked out that he was a Prophet inspired by Allah, and sent to people. He knows what is unknown."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another version, the Prophet [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"‘Adi, embrace Islam and you shall be secure." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"But I am a man of religion," said ‘Adi. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know your religion better than you," said the Prophet. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Do you know my religion better than me?" ‘Adi asked. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes," and the Prophet replied. </p>
<p>"Are you not cast in disbelief because you appropriate to yourself the fourth of your people’s gains?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yes," said ‘Adi. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is unlawful in your religion to do such a thing." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet said, and ‘Adi added: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He did not need to say it again for I immediately acquiesced it."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Invasion of Tabuk in Rajab, in the Year 9 A.H.</h2>
<p>The invasion and the conquest of Makkah was considered a decisive one between the truth and the error. As a result of this, the Arabs had no more doubt in Muhammad’s mission. Thus, we see that things went contrary to the pagans’ expectations. People started to embrace Islam, the religion of Allah, in great numbers. This is manifested clearly in the chapter — The delegations, of this book. It can also be deduced from the enormous number of people who shared in the Hajjatul-Wadâ‘ (Farewell Pilgrimage). All domestic troubles came to an end. Muslims, eventually felt at ease and started setting up the teachings of Allah’s Laws and intensifying the Call to Islam.</p>
<h3>The Underlying Reasons</h3>
<p>The Byzantine power, which was considered the greatest military force on earth at that time, showed an unjustifiable opposition towards Muslims. As we have already mentioned, their opposition started at the killing of the ambassador of the Messenger of Allah [pbuh], Al-Harith bin ‘Umair Al-Azdi, by Sharhabeel bin ‘Amr Al-Ghassani. The ambassador was then carrying a message from the Prophet [pbuh] to the ruler of Busra. We have also stated that the Prophet consequently dispatched a brigade under the command of Zaid bin Haritha, who had a fierce fight against the Byzantines at Mu’tah. Although Muslim forces could not have revenge on those haughty, over-proud tyrants, the confrontation itself had a great impression on the Arabs, all over Arabia.</p>
<p>Caesar — who could neither ignore the great benefit that the Mu’tah Battle had brought to Muslims, nor could he disregard the Arab tribes’ expectations of independence, and their hopes of getting free from his influence and reign, nor could he ignore their alliance to the Muslims — realizing all that, Caesar was aware of the progressive danger threatening his borders, especially the Ash-Sham fronts which were neighboring Arab lands. So he concluded that demolition of the Muslims power had grown an urgent necessity. This decision of his should, in his opinion, be achieved before the Muslims become too powerful to conquer, and raise troubles and unrest in the adjacent Arab territories.</p>
<h3>General News about the Byzantines and Ghassanide Preparations for War</h3>
<p>No sooner news about the Byzantine’s preparations for a decisive invasion against Muslims reached Madinah than fear spread among them. They started to envisage the Byzantine invasion in the least sound they could hear. This could be clearly worked out from what happened to ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab one day. </p>
<p>The Prophet [pbuh] had taken an oath to stay off his wives for a month in the ninth year of Al-Hijra. Therefore, he deserted them and kept off in a private place. At the beginning, the Companions of the Messenger of Allah were puzzled and could not work out the reason for such behavior. They thought the Prophet [pbuh] had divorced them and that was why he was grieved, disturbed, and upset. In ‘Umar’s version of the very story, he says: </p>
<p>"I used to have a Helper friend who often informed me about what happened if I weren’t present, and in return, I always informed him of what took place during his absence. They both lived in the high part of Madinah. Both of them used to call at the Prophet alternatively during that time of suspense. Then one day I heard my friend knocking at the door saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Open up! Open up!" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked, wondering, "What’s the matter? Has the Ghassanide come?" "No, it is more serious than that. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] has deserted his wives." [Sahih Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p>In another version, ‘Umar said, </p>
<p>"We talked about Ghassanide preparations to invade us. When it was his turn to convey the news to me, he went down and returned in the evening. He knocked at the door violently and said: ‘Is he sleeping?’ I was terrified but I went out to meet him. ‘Something serious had taken place.’ He said. ‘Has the Ghassanides arrived?’ said I. ‘No,’ he said, ‘it is greater and more serious. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] has divorced his wives.’" </p>
<p>This state of too much alertness manifests clearly the seriousness of the situation that Muslims began to experience. The seriousness of the situation was confirmed to a large degree by the hypocrites' behavior when news about the Byzantines’ preparations reached Madinah. The fact that the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] won all the battles he fought, and that no power on earth could make him terrified, and that he had always proved to be able to overcome all the obstacles that stood in his way - did not prevent the hypocrites who concealed evil in their hearts from expecting an affliction to fall upon the Muslims and Islam.</p>
<p>They used to harbor evil and ill-intentions against the whole process of Islam and the Muslims. On grounds of illusory hopes of destroying this great religious edifice, they erected a hotbed of conspiracy and intrigue in the form of a mosque — Masjid-e-Darar (the mosque of harm). They approached the Prophet [pbuh] with the request that he should come and consecrate the place by praying in it himself. As he was at the moment about to start for Tabuk, he deferred compliance with their request till his return. Meanwhile, he came to know through Divine Revelation that it was not a Mosque for devotion and prayer but a meeting place for the anti-Islamic elements. On his return, therefore, the Prophet [pbuh] sent a party to demolish the new structure.</p>
<h3>Particular News about the Byzantine and Ghassanide Preparations for War</h3>
<p>A magnified image of the prominent danger threatening the Muslims life was carried to them by the Nabateans who brought oil from Ash-Sham to Madinah. They carried news about Heraclius’ preparations and equipment of an enormous army counting over forty thousand fighters besides Lukham, Judham and other tribes allied to the Byzantines. They said that its vanguard had already reached Al-Balqâ’. Thus, the grave situation was standing in ambush for the Muslims.</p>
<p>The general situation was aggravated seriously by other adverse factors of too much hot weather, drought, and the rough and rugged distance they had to cover in case they decided to encounter the imminent danger. The Messenger of Allâh’s [pbuh] concept and estimation of the situation and its development was more precise and accurate than all others. He thought that if he tarried or dealt passively with the situation in such a way that might enable the Byzantines to paddle through the Islamic controlled provinces or to go as far as Madinah, this would — amid these circumstances — leave the most awful impression on Islam as well as on the Muslims’ military credibility.</p>
<p>The pre-Islamic beliefs and traditions (Al-Jahiliyah), which were at that time dying because of the strong decisive blow that they had already had at Hunain, could have a way to come back to life once again in such an environment. The hypocrites who were conspiring against the Muslims so that they might stab them in the back while the Byzantines would attack them from the front. If such a thing came to light and they succeeded in their evil attempts, the Prophet and his Companions’ efforts to spread Islam would collapse, and the profits which were the consequences of successive and constant fights and invasions would be invalidated. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] realized all that very well. </p>
<p>So — in spite of the hardships and drought that Muslims were suffering from — the Prophet [pbuh] was determined that the Muslims should invade the Byzantines and fight a decisive battle at their own borders. He was determined not to tarry at all in order to thwart any Roman attempt to approach the land of Islam.</p>
<p>When the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] had made up his mind and took his final decision, he ordered his Companions to get ready for war and sent for the Makkans and the other Arab tribes asking for their assistance. Contrary to his habit of concealing his real intention of the invasion by means of declaring a false one, he announced openly his intention of meeting the Byzantines and fighting them. He cleared the situation to his people so that they would get ready, and urged them to fight in the way of Allah. On this occasion, a part of Surat Bara’a (Chapter 9 — The Repentance) was sent down by Allah, urging them to steadfastness and stamina.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] cherished them to pay charities and to spend the best of their fortunes in the way of Allah. No sooner had the Muslims heard the voice of the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] calling them to fight the Byzantines than they rushed to comply with his orders. With great speed, they started getting ready for war. Tribes and phratries from here and there began pouring in Madinah. Almost all the Muslims responded positively. Only those who had weakness in their hearts favored to stay behind. They were only three people. Even the needy and the poor who could not afford a ride came to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] asking for one so that they would be able to share in the fight against the Byzantines. But when he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can find no mounts for you," they turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears of grief that they could not find anything to spend (for Jihad). [Al-Qur'an 9:92]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Muslims raced to spend out money and to pay charities to provide this invasion. ‘Uthman, for instance, who had already rigged two hundred saddled camels to travel to Ash-Sham, presented them all with two hundred ounces (of gold) as charity. He also fetched a thousand dinars and cast them all into the lap of the Messenger of Allah [pbuh], who turned them over and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From this day on nothing will harm ‘Uthman regardless of what he does." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again and again ‘Uthman gave till his charity topped nine hundred camels and a hundred horses, besides the money he paid.</p>
<p>Abdur Rahman bin ‘Awf, on his side, paid two hundred silver ounces, whereas Abu Bakr paid the whole money he had and left nothing but Allah and His Messenger as a fortune for his family. ‘Umar paid half his fortune. Al-‘Abbas gifted a lot of money. Talhah, Sa‘d bin ‘Ubadah and Muhammad bin Maslamah gave money for the welfare of the invasion. ‘Asim bin ‘Adi, on his turn, offered ninety camel-burdens of dates. People raced to pay little and much charities alike. One of them gave the only half bushel (or the only bushel) he owned. Women shared in this competition by giving the things they owned, such as musk, armlets, anklets, earrings and rings. No one abstained from spending out money, or was too mean to grant money or anything except the hypocrites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Those who defame such of the believers who give charity (in Allah’s cause) voluntarily, and those who could not find to give charity (in Allah’s cause) except what is available to them, so they mock at them (believers)." [Al-Qur'an 9:79]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Muslim Army is Leaving for Tabuk</h3>
<p>Upon accomplishing the equipment of the army, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] ordained that Muhammad bin Maslamah Al-Ansari should be appointed over Madinah — in another version Siba‘ bin ‘Arftah. To ‘Ali bin Abu Talib, he entrusted his family’s safety and affairs and ordered him to stay with them. This move made the hypocrites undervalue ‘Ali, so he followed the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] and caught up with him. But the Prophet made ‘Ali turn back to Madinah after saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Would it not suffice you to be my successor in the way that Aaron (Harun) was to Moses?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he proceeded saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But no Prophet succeeds me." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Thursday, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] marched northwards to Tabuk. The army that numbered thirty thousand fighters was a great one compared with the previous armies of Islam. Muslims had never marched with such a great number before.</p>
<p>Despite all the gifts of wealth and mounts, the army was not perfectly equipped. The shortage of provisions and mounts was so serious that eighteen men mounted one camel alternatively. As for provisions, members of the army at times had to eat the leaves of trees till their lips got swollen. Some others had to slaughter camels — though they were so dear — so that they could drink the water of their stomach; that is why that army was called "The army of distress."</p>
<p>On their way to Tabuk, the army of Islam passed by Al-Hijr — which was the native land of Thamud who cut out (huge) rocks in the valley; that is "Al-Qura Valley" of today. They watered from its well but later the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] told them not to drink of that water, nor perform the ablution with it. The dough they made, he asked them to feed their camels with. He forbade them to eat anything whatsoever of it. As an alternative, he told them to water from that well which Prophet Salih’s she-camel used to water from.</p>
<p>On the authority of Ibn ‘Umar: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon passing by Al-Hijr the Prophet [pbuh] said: 'Do not enter the houses of those who erred themselves lest what had happened to them should afflict you, but if you had to do such a thing let it be associated with weeping.'" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he raised his head up and accelerated his strides till he passed the valley out. [Sahih Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p>Shortage of water and the army’s need for it made them complain to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] about that. So he supplicated Allah, who sent a rainful cloud. It rained, and all people drank and supplied themselves with their need of water. </p>
<p>When they drew near Tabuk, the Prophet said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If Allah wills, tomorrow you will arrive at Tabuk spring. You will not get there before daytime. So whoever reaches it should not touch its water; but wait till I come." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mu‘adh said: "When we reached the spring, it used to gush forth some water. We found that two men had already preceded us to it. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] asked them: ‘Have you touched its water?’ They replied: ‘Yes’. He said what Allah inspired him to say, then he scooped up little water of that spring, a thin stream which gathered together, washed his face and hand with it, and poured it back into it; consequently, plenty of water spouted out of it so people watered. ‘Mu‘adh’, said the Messenger of Allah, ‘if you were doomed to live long life you will see in here fields full of vegetation.’" [Sahih Muslim]</p>
<p>On the way to Tabuk, or as soon as they reached Tabuk, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Severe wind will blow tonight, so none of you should stand up. Whoever has a camel should tie it up." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on when the strong wind blew, one of the men stood up and the wind carried him away to Tai’ Mountain. [Sahih Muslim]</p>
<p>All the way long, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] was intent on the performance of the combined prayer of noon and the afternoon; and so did he with sunset and evening prayers. His prayers for both were either pre-time or post-time prayers.</p>
<h2>The Army of Islam at Tabuk</h2>
<p>Arriving at Tabuk and camping there, the Muslim army was ready to face the enemy. There, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] delivered an eloquent speech that included the most inclusive words. In that speech, he urged the Muslims to seek the welfare of this world and the world to come. He warned and cherished them and gave them good tidings. By doing that, he cherished those who were broken in spirits, and blocked up the gap of shortage and mess they were suffering from due to lack of supplies, food, and other substances.</p>
<p>Upon learning of the Muslims’ march, the Byzantines and their allies were so terrified that none of them dared to set out to fight. On the contrary, they scattered inside their territory. It brought, in itself, a good credit to the Muslim forces. That had gained military reputation in the mid and remote lands of the Arabian Peninsula. The great and serious political profits that the Muslim forces had obtained were far better than the ones they could have acquired if the two armies had been engaged in military confrontation.</p>
<p>The Head of Ailah, Yahna bin Rawbah came to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh], made peace with him, and paid him the tribute (Al-Jizya). Both the Jarba’ and Adhruh peoples paid him tribute as well. So the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] gave each a guarantee letter, similar to Yahna’s, in which he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This is a guarantee of protection from Allah and Muhammad the Prophet, the Messenger of Allah, to Yahna bin Rawbah and the people of Ailah; their ships, and their caravans on land and sea shall have the custody of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad, he and whosoever are with him of Ash-Sham people and those of the sea. Whosoever contravenes this treaty, his wealth shall not save him; it shall be the fair prize of him that takes it. Now it should not be lawful to hinder the men from any springs which they have been in the habit of frequenting, nor from any journeys they desire to make, whether by sea or by land."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] dispatched Khalid bin Al-Waleed at the head of four hundred and fifty horsemen to ‘Ukaidir Dumat Al-Jandal and said to him: "You will see him hunting oryxes." So when Khalid drew near his castle and was as far as an eyesight range, he saw the oryxes coming out rubbing their horns against the castle gate. As it was a moony night, Khalid could see Ukaidir come out to hunt them, so he captured him — though he was surrounded by his men — and brought him back to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh], who spared his life and made peace with him for the payment of two thousand camels, eight hundred heads of cattle, four hundred armours, and four hundred lances. He obliged him to recognize the duty of paying tribute and charged him with collecting it from Dumat, Tabuk, Ailah, and Taima’.</p>
<p>The tribes, who used to ally with the Byzantines, became quite certain that their dependence on their former masters had come to an end. Therefore, they turned into being pro-Muslims. The Islamic state had enlarged its borders to an extent that it touched the Byzantines’ and their agents’ borders. So we see that the Byzantine agents' role was over.</p>
<h2>Returning to Madinah</h2>
<p>The Muslim army returned from Tabuk victoriously, undeceived or wronged. That was because Allah had sufficed them the evils of fight. On the way back and at a mountain road, twelve hypocrites sought the Prophet’s life while he was passing along that mountain road with only Ammar holding the rein of his she-camel and Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman driving it, at the time that people had already gone down into the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p>The hypocrites seized that opportunity to seek the Prophet’s life. As the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] and his two companions were moving along, they heard thrusts of people coming towards him from behind with their faces veiled. Hudhaifa, who was sent by the Prophet to see what was going on, saw them and struck their mounts’ faces with a crook in his hand, and Allah cast fear into their hearts. They fled away and overtook their people.</p>
<p>However, Hudhaifa named them to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] and informed him of their intentions. That was why Hudhaifa was called the "confidant" of the Messenger of Allah [pbuh]. About this event, Allah, the Exalted says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And they resolved that (to plot to murder Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) which they were unable to carry out." [Al-Qur'an 9:74]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When his headquarters, Madinah, began to loom at the horizon, the Prophet [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a cheerful sight. This is Uhud, which is a mountain, we like it, and it likes us." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Madinese learned of their arrival, they set out to meet the army. Women, youths, youngsters, and small children went out of town to celebrate their home-return wholeheartedly singing: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The full moon shone down upon us, through the traits of Al-Wada‘ Mountain. Thanks is due to us, as long as a supplicator invokes to Allah..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] ’s march to Tabuk was in Rajab and his return in Ramadan. So we see that this Ghazwah took fifty days, twenty days of which were spent in Tabuk and the others on the way to and fro. The Tabuk Invasion was the last one made by the Prophet [pbuh].</p>
<h3>The People Who Lagged Behind</h3>
<p>Due to its particular circumstances, this invasion was a peculiar, severe trial provided by Allah only to try the believers’ faith and sort them out of others. This is Allah’s permanent Will in such circumstances. In this respect, He says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good." [Al-Qur'an 3:179]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lagging and hanging back from full participation in that invasion amounted to the degree of hypocrisy. Whenever the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] was informed of a man’s lingering, he would say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Leave him alone! If Allah knows him to be good, He will enable him to follow you; but if he were not so, Allah would relieve us of him." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody stayed behind except those who were either hindered by a serious excuse or the hypocrites who told lies to Allah and His Messenger.</p>
<p>Some of those hypocrites’ lingering was due to an excuse based on forgery and delusion. Some others tarried but didn’t ask for instant permission. But there were three believers who unjustifiably lingered. They were the ones whom Allah tried their Faith, but later on He turned to them in mercy and accepted their repentance. </p>
<p>As soon as the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] had entered Madinah, he prayed two Rak‘a then he sat to receive his people. The hypocrites who were over eighty men came and offered various kinds of excuses and started swearing. The Prophet acknowledged their excuses and invoked Allah’s forgiveness for them but he entrusted their inner thoughts and Faith to Allah.</p>
<p>As for the three faithful believers — Ka‘b bin Malik, Murara bin Ar-Rabi‘, and Hilal bin Omaiyah — who favored telling the truth, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] bade his Companions not to talk to them. Consequently, they were subject to a severe boycott and were excluded from the life of the community. Everybody turned their back on them. So they felt as if the whole land had become constrained to them in spite of its spaciousness and they felt awkward and uneasy. </p>
<p>The hard times they lived and which lasted for over forty days were towered by an order to them to forsake their wives. After fifty days of boycott, Allah turned to them and revealed that in the Qur’an:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And (He did forgive also) the three (whom the Prophet Õáì Çááå Úáíå æ Óáã) left (i.e. he did not give his judgement in their case, and their case was suspended for Allah’s Decision) till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their own selves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He accepted their repentance, that they might repent (unto Him). Verily, Allah is the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful." [Al-Qur'an 9:118]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allah’s turning to them was a great joy for both Muslims and the three concerned. The joy of the stayers behind was unaccountable in aim and degree. It was the happiest day in their lives. The good tidings cherished them and filled their hearts with delight. As for those who lingered due to disability or sickness or any other serious excuse, Allah, the Exalted said about them: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no blame on those who are weak or ill or who find no resources to spend [in holy warfare (Jihad)], if they are sincere (in duty) to Allah and His Messenger." [Al-Qur'an 9:91]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he approached Madinah, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Inside Madinah, there are certain men, who though being left back due to serious excuses, they have, all the time, been with you. Lingerers as they are, they have been while you were passing valleys or walking along roads." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Do you mean that they have done that while they are still in Madinah?" They wondered. </p>
<p>"Yes, though they are in Madinah," the Prophet said. </p>
<h2>The Invasion of Tabuk and its Far-Reaching Ramifications</h2>
<p>The effect of this invasion is great as regards extending and confirming the Muslims’ influence and domination over the Arabian Peninsula. It was quite obvious to everybody that no power but Islam’s would live long among the Arabs. The remainders of Jahiliyin and hypocrites — who used to conspire steadily against the Muslims and who perpetually relied on Byzantine power when they were in need of support or help — these people lost their expectations and desires of ever reclaiming their ex-influence. Realizing that there was no way out and that they were to submit to the fait accompli, they gave up their attempts.</p>
<p>From that time on, hypocrites were no longer treated leniently or even gently by the Muslims. Allah not only bade Muslims to treat them severely but He also forbade them to take their gift charities or perform prayer on their dead, or ask Allah’s forgiveness for them or even visit their tombs. Allah bade the Muslims to demolish the mosque, which they verily appointed and used as a hiding place where they might practice their plots, conspiracy, and deceit. Some Qur’anic verses were sent down disclosing them publicly and utterly so that everybody in Madinah got to know their reality.</p>
<p>The great impact that this invasion produced could be perceived in the great number of delegations who came successively to meet the Messenger of Allah [pbuh]. Naturally, deputations used to come to meet him at the end of an invasion particularly after the Makkah Conquest. However, they were not as many as these nor were they as frequent as they were then in the wake of the Tabuk event. It was certainly the greatest.</p>
<h2>The Qur’anic Verses Relating to this Invasion</h2>
<p>Many verses of Bara’a (Tauba) Chapter handling the event of Tabuk were revealed. Some verses were revealed before the march, while others after setting out for Tabuk, i.e., in the context of the battle. Some other verses were also revealed on the Prophet’s arrival in Madinah. All of which covered the incidents that featured this invasion, the imminent circumstances of the battle, exposure of the hypocrites, the prerogatives and special rank earmarked for the strivers in the cause of Allah, acceptance of the repentance of the truthful believers who slackened, and those who hung back, etc.</p>
<h2>Some Important Events that featured that Year</h2>
<p>During this year, many events of great significance took place. They were: </p>
<ol>
<li>After the Messenger’s return from Tabuk, the sworn allegation of infidelity between ‘Uwaimir Al-‘Ajlani and his wife took place. </li>
<li>Pelting with stones the Ghamidiyah woman who confessed committing adultery. She was pelted with stones only after weaning her child off her breast milk. </li>
<li>Negus Ashama, the king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), died so the Prophet [pbuh] performed prayer in absentia for him. </li>
<li>The death of Umm Kulthum, the daughter of the Prophet [pbuh]; the Prophet felt extremely sad at her death. </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"Had I got a third daughter, I would let you marry her," he said to ‘Uthman.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The death of ‘Abdullah bin Abi Salool, the head of hypocrites, after the Prophet’s return from Tabuk. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] asked Allah’s forgiveness for him. He also prayed for him in spite of ‘Umar’s disapproval and his attempt to prevent him from doing that. Later on, a Qur’anic verse was revealed attesting to ‘Umar’s right viewpoint.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Abu Bakr [R] Performs the Pilgrimage</h2>
<p>In the month Dhul-Qa‘dah or in Dhul-Hijjah of the very year (the ninth of Al-Hijra), the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] dispatched Abu Bakr [R], the truthful, as a deputy prince of Al-Hajj (pilgrimage), so that he would lead the Muslims in performing the pilgrimage rituals.</p>
<p>Soon after the departure of the Muslims, there came a Revelation from Allah: the opening passages of Chapter 9 entitled ‘Repentance’ (Surah Tauba or Bara’a) in which ‘freedom from obligation’ is proclaimed from Allah in regard to those idolatrous tribes who had shown no respect for the treaties which they had entered into with the Prophet [pbuh]. The communication of this news went in line with the Arabian traditions of making public any change relating to declining conventions of blood and fortunes.</p>
<p>‘Ali bin Abi Talib was deputed to make this declaration. He overtook Abu Bakr at Al-‘Arj or Dajnan. Abu Bakr inquired whether the Prophet [pbuh] had put him in command or he had just been commissioned to make the announcement. "I have been deputed to make the proclamation only," replied ‘Ali. The two Companions then proceeded with the pilgrimage process. Towards the close of the rituals, on the day of the ritual sacrifice, ‘Ali stood at Al-Jamrah (a spot at which stones are pelted) and read aloud to the multitudes that thronged around him and declared quittance from covenants with idolaters and giving them four months’ respite to reconsider their position. As for the other idolaters with whom the believers had a treaty and had abated nothing of the Muslims’ rights nor had supported anyone against them, then the terms of the treaty would run valid until the duration of which expired. </p>
<p>Abu Bakr then sent some Muslims to declare publicly that no disbeliever would after that year perform pilgrimage, nor would anyone be allowed to make the Tawaf (going round) of the Sacred House unclothed. That proclamation in fact vetoed all aspects of paganism out of Arabia and stated quite unequivocally that those pre-Islam practices were no longer in operation. [Sahih Al-Bukhari]</p>
<h2>A Meditation on the Ghazawat</h2>
<p>Meditation on the Prophet’s Ghazawat, missions, and the battalions he formed and dispatched, will certainly give us and everybody a true and clear impression that the Prophet [pbuh] was the greatest military leader in the whole world as well as the most righteous, the most insightful, and the most alert one. He was not a man of superior genius for this concern but he was also the Master and the greatest of all Messengers as far as Prophethood and Heavenly Message are concerned. Besides, all the battles that he had fought were standard in their application to the requirements of strictness, bravery, and good arrangements that fitted the terms and conditions of war. None of the battles he fought was lost as a consequence of a shortage of wisdom or due to any other technical error in army mobilization or a location in a wrong strategic position. </p>
<p>The loss of any of his battles was not due to misjudgment about occupying the best and the most appropriate sites of battles, nor was it due to a mischoice of leaders of the fight, for he had proved himself to be a peculiar sort of leader that differs from any of those leaders that our world had known and experienced. As regards Uhud and Hunain events, there were consequences of weakness in some military elements in Hunain; and disobedience to orders in Uhud. Their non-compliance with wisdom and the plan of the battle played a passive role in the course of those two invasions.</p>
<p>His genius was clearly shown in these two battles when the Muslims were defeated; for he stood fast facing the enemy and managed, by his super wisdom, to thwart the enemy’s aim, as was the case in Uhud. Similarly, he managed to turn the Muslims’ defeat in Hunain into a victory, notwithstanding the fact that serious grave developments in military operations usually leave the worst impression on the military leaders and entice them to flee for their lives.</p>
<p>We have, so far, discussed the mere aspects of military leadership of the invasions. On the other hand, through these invasions he was able to impose security, institute peace, diffuse dissension, and destroy the military might of the enemies through relentless struggle between Islam and paganism.</p>
<p>The Prophet had also profound insight and could differentiate the faithful from the hypocrites and plotters. Great was the group of military leaders who fought and excelled the Persians and the Byzantines in the battlefields of Ash-Sham and Iraq with respect to war strategy and leading the fight procedures. The very leaders who succeeded Muhammad [pbuh] managed to drive off the enemies of Islam from their lands and countries, their gardens and springs, and their farms. They drove them off their honourable residence and from the grace and provisions they owned and enjoyed. Those Muslim leaders were all Muhammad’s men. They were imbued with the spirit of Islam at the hand of the Prophet [pbuh]. </p>
<p>Thanks to these battles, the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] managed accommodation, secured land, and provided chances of work for all Muslims. He even made a lot of inquiries about the refugee problems who then had no houses or fortunes. He equipped the army with weapons, horses, and expenditures. He had all that realized without exercising a particle weight of injustice. The Prophet [pbuh] has altered the standards and aims of pre-Islamic wars. Their war was no more than robbing, killing, plundering, tyranny, and aggression-oriented wars. Those wars focused on winning victory, oppressing the weakling, and demolishing their houses and constructions. </p>
<p>For them, war was a means by which they could rape or unveil women, practice cruelty against the weakling, the babies, and small children, spoil tillage and race, and spread corruption on the earth. Islamic wars are different from pre-Islamic wars. A "war" in Islam is a Jihad. That is to say it is a noble sacred fight in the way of Allah for the verification of a Muslim society that seeks to free man from oppression, tyranny, and aggression. </p>
<p>It is a society that everyone everywhere and at all times should be proud of. Pre-Islamic thoughts and traditions of Al-Jahiliyah period have been turned upside down by Islam. These were so hard upon the weakling that they had to invoke Allah to enable them to get away from that pre-Islamic environment by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors, and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The war of corruption, slaying, and robbing that used to prevail has now turned into a sacred one, Al-Jihad. One of the greatest aims of Al-Jihad is to free man from the aggression, the oppression, and the tyranny of men of power. A man of power, in Islam, is a weakling till after the right of the poor is taken from him. War, in Islam, is a Jihad for the purification of the land of Allah from deception, treachery, sinful deeds, and aggression. </p>
<p>It is a sacred war that aims at spreading security, safety, mercy, and compassion, as well as observing the rights and magnanimity. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] had issued honourable strict rules about war and bade his soldiers and leaders to comply with them. They were forbidden to break those rules under any circumstances. In reference to Sulaiman bin Buraidah’s version, who said that his father had told him that whenever the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] appointed a leader on an army or on a battalion, he used to recommend him to fear Allah, the Great and All-Mighty, when dealing with those who were closest to him and to be good with all Muslims. Then the Prophet [pbuh] would say to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Let your invasion be in the Name of Allah and for His sake. Fight those who disbelieve in Allah. Invade but do not exaggerate nor commit treachery. Never deform the corpse of a dead person or kill an infant child."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] asked people to facilitate but forbade them to bear down hard on others or constrain. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pacify," he said, "and do not disincline." [Sahih Muslim]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it happened that he arrived at the battlefield by night, he would never invade the enemy till it was morning. He utterly forbade burning (i.e. torturing people) in fire, killing children and women, or even beating them. He also forbade theft and robbery and proceeded so far as to say gains acquired through plundering are not less forbidden than the flesh of a corpse. Corruption of tillage and race and cutting down of trees were all forbidden unless they were badly needed and there was no other substitute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do not kill a wounded person nor run after a fleeing one or kill a captive." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He decreed that envoys cannot be killed. He also stressed not killing those who made covenants. He even said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He who kills one who is under pledge to a covenant shall not smell Paradise, though its smell could be experienced at a forty-year distance from it." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were some other noble rules which purified wars from their Al-Jahiliyah (pre-Islamic) filthiness and turned them into sacred wars. </p>
<h2>People Embrace the Religion of Allah in Large Crowds</h2>
<p>The invasion and the conquest of Makkah was — as we have already stated — a decisive battle that destroyed paganism utterly. The Arabs as a result of that battle were able to differentiate the truth from the error. Delusion no longer existed in their life. So they raced to embrace Islam. ‘Amr bin Salamah said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We were at a water (spring) where the passage of people was. So when camel riders passed by us we used to ask them: ‘What is the matter with people? What is this man (i.e. the Prophet) like?’ They would say, ‘He claims that Allah has revealed so and so.’ I used to memorize those words as if they had been recited within my chest." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Arabs used to ascribe their Islamization to the conquest. They would say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Leave him alone to face his people. If he were a truthful Prophet, he would overcome them." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when the conquest took place, peoples hastened to declare their Islam. My father was the quickest of all my people to embrace Islam. Arriving at his people he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By Allah I have just verily been to the Prophet [pbuh]. And he said: ‘Perform so a prayer at such a time, and so and so prayers at such and such time. When the prayer time is due let one of you call for the prayer and appoint the most learned of the Qur’ân among you to be an Imam (leader) of yours." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Prophetic tradition manifests the great effect of the conquest of Makkah on the phase of events. It certainly shows the influence of the conquest of Makkah upon the consolidation of Islam as well as on the Arabs’ stand and their surrender to Islam. </p>
<p>That influence was absolutely confirmed and deeply rooted after the invasion of Tabuk. A clear and obvious evidence of that influence could be deduced from the great number of delegations arriving in Madinah successively in the ninth and tenth years of Al-Hijra. The immense crowds of people who raced to embrace the religion of Allah and the great army which included ten thousand fighters in the invasion of the conquest of Makkah had grown big enough to include thirty thousand fighters sharing in the Tabuk invasion. It was only in less than a year after the conquest of Makkah that this growth in the Islamic army had taken place. </p>
<p>A hundred thousand or a hundred and forty-four thousand Muslim pilgrims shared in Hajjatul-Wada‘ (i.e. Farewell Pilgrimage); it was such an enormous number of Muslims surging — as an ocean of men — round the Messenger of Allah [pbuh], that the horizon echoed their voices and the expanses of land shook thereby while saying Labbaik (i.e. Lord, here we are worshipping), glorifying and magnifying Allah, and thanking Him.</p>
<h2>The Delegations</h2>
<p>The number of delegations listed in Ahl Al-Maghazi were over seventy. Investigating such a large number is not an accessible thing; besides stating them in detail is not of a great benefit. Therefore, I am going to reveal an expose about what is historically wonderful or highly significant. Anyway, a reader should always keep in mind that whilst the majority of tribes arrived in Madinah after the conquest, there were also pre-conquest delegations.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The delegation of ‘Abdul Qais</strong>: This tribe had two arrivals. The first was in the fifth year of Al-Hijra or before that date. Munqidh bin Haiyan, a member of that tribe, used to trade in Madinah. So, as soon as he heard of Islam when he had arrived in it for trading — that was after the migration — he embraced Islam and carried a pledge from the Prophet [pbuh] to his people who eventually became Muslims too. Thirteen or fourteen of them came to the Prophet [pbuh] in one of the Hurum Months. It was then that they asked the Prophet’s advice about the Faith and drinks. Their chief was Al-Ashaj Al-Usri, to whom the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] said: </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"You have two qualities that Allah likes: They are deliberateness and clemency."  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their second arrival was in the Year of Delegations. They were forty men. Al-Jarud bin Al-‘Alâ’ Al-‘Abdi, who was Christian but turned to be a good Muslim, was one of that group.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Daws Delegation</strong>: The arrival of this tribe was in the early times of the seventh year and that was when the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] was in Khaibar. At-Tufail bin ‘Amr Ad-Dawsi, that we have already talked about and explained how he became a Muslim at the time the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] was in Makkah. He went back home to his people where he kept calling people to Islam but they tarried till he despaired of them and returned to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] and asked him to invoke Allah against Daws but the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] invoked Allah to guide Daws. Later on, Daws embraced Islam. </li>
</ol>
<p>So At-Tufail arrived in Madinah accompanied by seventy or eighty families of his people in the early times of the seventh year of Al-Hijra, at the time that the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] was at Khaibar, so he overtook him there.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Farwah Bani ‘Amr Al-Judhami’s messenger</strong>: Farwah was an Arab leader in the Byzantine army. He was a Byzantine agent ruler by proxy on the Arabs allied to the Byzantines. His home was at Mu‘an and the surrounding area of Ash-Sham lands. Seeing the stamina and courage of the Muslims, he became a Muslim. The battle of Mu’tah — which took place in the eighth year of Al-Hijra — compelled his admiration. He sent a white mule gift with a messenger of his to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] to inform him of his conversion to Islam. When the Byzantines learned of his embracing Islam, they sent him to prison. At first, they gave him an opportunity to choose one of the two —"either he defects from Islam or death shall be his punishment." Refusing to defect, they crucified him and cut his neck at a water (fountain) called ‘Afra’ in Palestine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sudâ’ Delegation</strong>: The arrival of this delegation was after the departure of the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] from Al-Ji‘ranah in the eighth year of Al-Hijra. It was because the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] had already dispatched a mission that comprised four hundred Muslims and asked them to go to where Sudâ’ was. Sudâ’ was (a fresh-water fountain) in Yemen. While the mission was camping there at the starting point of a canal, Ziyad bin Al-Harith As-Sudâ’i learned of their stay, so he came to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] and said: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have come to you as a deputy of my people, so tell your army to go back and I guarantee my people." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The army were sent away off the canal. In his turn, As-Sudâ’i went back, cherished and urged his people to come and meet the Messenger of Allah [pbuh]. Eventually, fifteen of them came and pledged allegiance to him as true Muslims. Returning home, they in their turn, urged the rest to be Muslims. Thus Islam spread among them. Later on, a hundred men joined the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] in Hajjatul-Wada‘ (Farewell Pilgrimage).</p>

<li><strong>The arrival of Ka‘b bin Zuhair bin Abi Sulma</strong>: Ka‘b who was a member of a family of poets, was considered one of the most poetic Arab poets. He used to satirize the Prophet [pbuh] when he wasn’t a Muslim. In the eighth year of Al-Hijra and at the time that the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] had already gone back from the At-Ta’if invasion, Bujair bin Zuhair wrote a letter to his brother Ka‘b warning and advising him: </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Messenger of Allah ([pbuh]) had killed some men in Makkah who used to satirize and harm him, and that the other poets who had survived fled in all directions for their lives. So if you want to save your skin, hasten to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh]. He never kills those who resort to him as repentant. If you refuse to do as I tell, it is up to you to try to save your skin by any means." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two brothers corresponded with one another for a long time till Ka‘b was awkward and felt as if the earth had constrained on him. Arriving in Madinah, he stayed at a man’s house from Juhainah as a guest. They performed the dawn prayer together; but when he was about to leave, the man suggested that he go to the Messenger of Allah [pbuh]. He went there, sat by him, put his hand in his. The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] who had never seen Ka‘b before, did not recognize him. Ka‘b then said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O, Messenger of Allah! Ka‘b bin Zuhair has come to you as a repentant Muslim; will he be secure and forgiven if I fetch him?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allah [pbuh] said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I am Ka‘b bin Zuhair," said he. </p>
<p>Upon hearing that one of the Helpers rose to his feet and asked the Messenger’s allowance to cut his throat. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Leave him alone!" said the Prophet [pbuh], "He has become a repentant Muslim after his disposal of the past." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ka‘b then recited his well-known poem "Su‘ad appeared..." in which he praised the Prophet [pbuh], thanked him, and apologized for the wrongs he had done. He acknowledged Muhammad’s mission. Both Emigrants and Helpers were spoken of in this poem but differently. He praised the Emigrants but criticized the Helpers, for one of them demanded a Prophet’s permission to kill him. Later on, Ka‘b tried to compensate for that by praising the Helpers too but that was in another poem.</p>

<li><strong>‘Udharah Delegation</strong>: This delegation which consisted of twelve men, had arrived in Madinah in Safar, the ninth year of Al-Hijra. They spent three days there. One of them was Hamza bin An-Nu‘man. When they were asked who they were, they said "We are Bani ‘Udharah, the foster brothers of Qusai to his mother. We are the ones who supported Qusai and removed Khuza’a and Bani Bakr from the bosom of Makkah. We have relatives and kinspeople." </li>
</ol>
<p>So the Messenger of Allah [pbuh] welcomed them and gave good tidings to them, which was Ash-Sham Conquest; but he, on the other hand, forbade them from consulting a soothsayer and from eating the slain animals they...</p><p><a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_12">Previous</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/index.html">Index</a> | <a href="https:/haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/2024_sn/chunk_14">Next</a></p></body>
