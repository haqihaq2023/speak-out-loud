<p>The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) faced multiple military and social challenges. The narrative first details his confrontation with Banu Qurayza, a Jewish tribe that betrayed the Muslim community during the Battle of the Confederates. When the siege ended, the tribe accepted the arbitration of Sa'd bin Mu'adh, a respected ally of the Prophet. Sa'd decreed that the able-bodied men should be executed while women and children were taken as captives, a judgment that was seen as compliant with divine will due to the tribe's treachery. The decision marked a severe yet decisive action to halt the cycle of betrayal and warfare against the nascent Muslim state. The aftermath saw the consolidation of Muslim control and resources, further enabling their defensive capabilities against external threats.</p>
<p>Following the resolution of this conflict, Islam's expansion continued through strategic military expeditions and diplomatic engagements. Such missions were not merely acts of territorial conquest but were often reactions to ongoing threats or acts of aggression, as exemplified by the assassination of formidable adversaries like Salam bin Abi Al-Huqaiq by a Muslim contingent following Prophetic approval. These skirmishes underscored the Prophet's broader strategy to secure the newly established Muslim community by counteracting hostile forces and reframing the regional balance of power. Episodes like the capture and subsequent conversion of Thumamah bin Uthal, a notable adversary, exemplified Islam's transformative potential even amidst conflict.</p>
<p>However, the internal landscape was fraught with challenges from hypocrites within the Muslim ranks. Individuals like 'Abdullah bin Ubai sought to fracture the community through slander and incitements, as seen during the Bani Mustaliq expedition. Such elements attempted to exploit sensitive matters, including the slander against Ayesha, the Prophet's wife, to destabilize and discredit Muhammad's leadership. These incidents revealed the complex dynamics within the community, necessitating not only military might but also ethical and governance strategies to uphold unity and justice. Revelations from the Qur'an during these times reinforced moral principles and provided clarity, ensuring that the community was guided by divine wisdom amidst trials.</p>
<h1>Main Text</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>People do that. They immediately gave the man back all his wealth. He went back to Makkah, gave over the trusts to those entitled to them, embraced Islam and emigrated to Madinah where the Prophet (pbuh) reunited him with his wife, Zainab, after three and a half years of their first marriage contract. The verse relating to the prohibition of marriage between women Muslims and disbelievers had not been revealed then. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Battles and Expeditions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In Jumada Ath-Thania, the same year, Zaid at the head of fifteen men raided Bani Tha‘labah and captured twenty of their camels but the people had fled. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Rajab of the same year, Zaid, at the head of twelve men, set out to a place called Wadi Al-Qura in a reconnaissance mission to explore the movements of the enemy. The people there attacked the Muslims, killed nine of them, while the rest including Zaid bin Haritha managed to escape. </p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>The invasion of Al-Khabt (diluted yoghurt) took place in the year eight Hijri i.e., before Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty. Abu ‘Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah led three hundred horsemen to observe a caravan belonging to the Quraish. Because of the inadequacy of food supplies, they began to starve so much that they had Khabt (diluted yoghurt), hence the appellation "The Army of Al-Khabt". One of the men slaughtered nine camels at three times, three each time at different stages of the mission. Abu ‘Ubaidah, the leader of the campaign prohibited him from doing so. The sea was generous and presented them with an animal called Al-‘Anbar (sperm-whale) so rich in fat that they subsisted on it for half a month. When they came back home, they narrated the story to the Prophet (pbuh), who commented that it was provision granted by Allâh, and asked them to share him some of its meat. </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/625,626; Sahih Muslim 2/145,146] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This campaign came chronologically prior to Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty because of and after which the Muslims stopped intercepting Quraishi caravans. </p>
<h2>Bani Al-Mustaliq (Muraisi‘) Ghazwah, Sha‘ban 6 Hijri</h2>
<p>Though militarily it did not assume its full dimension, this Ghazwah had certain implications that brought about a state of turbulence within the Islamic State, and resulted in disgracefulness to clothe in the hypocrites. Moreover, it entailed enactment of consolidating legislations that attached an impression of nobility, dignity and purity of souls to the Islamic community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>News reached the Prophet (pbuh) on Sha‘ban 2nd to the effect that the chief of Bani Al-Mustaliq, Al-Harith bin Dirar, had mobilized his men, along with some Arabs, to attack Madinah. Buraidah bin Al-Haseeb Al-Aslami was immediately dispatched to verify the reports. He had some words with Abi Dirar, who confirmed his intention of war. He later sent a reconnoiterer to explore the positions of the Muslims but he was captured and killed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) summoned his men and ordered them to prepare for war. Before leaving, Zaid bin Haritha was mandated to see to the affairs of Madinah and dispose of them. On hearing the advent of the Muslims, the disbelievers got frightened and the Arabs going with them defected and ran away to save their lives. Abu Bakr was entrusted with the banner of the Emigrants, and that of the Helpers went to Sa‘d bin ‘Ubada. The two armies were stationed at a well called Muraisi. Arrow shooting went on for an hour, and then the Muslims rushed and engaged with the enemy in a battle that ended in full victory for the Muslims. Some men were killed, women and children of the disbelievers taken as captives, and a lot of booty fell to the lot of the Muslims. Only one Muslim was killed by mistake by a Helper. Amongst the captives was Juwairiyah, daughter of Al-Harith, chief of the disbelievers. The Prophet (pbuh) married her and, in compensation, the Muslims had to manumit a hundred others of the enemy prisoners who embraced Islam, and were then called the Prophet’s in-laws.</p>

<h3>The Treacherous Role of the Hypocrites Prior to the Bani Al-Mustaliq Ghazwah</h3>
<p>‘Abdullah bin Ubai, a terrible hypocrite was full of rancour against Islam and the Muslims because he believed that the Prophet (pbuh) had dispossessed him of his leadership over Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, two clans already agreed on the Prophethood of Muhammad (pbuh) and his masterhood over them.</p>
<p>‘Abdullah’s rancour had appeared before he feigned Islam. Following the battle of Badr, he made pretensions of being a Muslim, but deep at heart, he remained that terrible enemy of Allâh, His Messenger, and all the believers, in general. His sole target had always been to sow the seeds of dissension in the Muslim community and undermine the cause of the new heavenly religion it has. His treacherous behaviour could be witnessed everywhere but was strikingly evident in his wicked attempts at creating a state of confusion and disorder amongst the Muslims at the Uhud Battle. His hypocrisy and deceit assumed serious and ugly dimensions when he used to stand up among the Muslims shortly before the Prophet’s Friday speech, and mockingly say to them: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is the Messenger of Allâh, who has honoured you with Allâh, so you have got to support, obey and listen to him," and then he would sit down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did the same following the Uhud Battle on Friday. He was so rude and presumptuous that his words smacked unmistakably of deeply-rooted rancour, so that some of the Muslims took him by his cloak reproachingly and silenced him. He immediately left, uttering rude and mocking words. A Helper met him at the Mosque gate and ordered him to return and beg the Messenger for Allâh’s forgiveness, but he retorted that he had never wanted him to ask for that. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Ibn Hisham 2/105] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He, moreover, conducted clandestine contacts with Bani Nadir, another tribe of Jews, encouraging them to make an alliance with him and promising support for them; all of this in his ceaseless efforts in a long process of conspiracy and intrigue hatched against the Muslims. Allâh’s Words as regards his treacherous acts and awe-inspiring attempts during the Trench Battle came to testify quite clearly to this mode of hypocrisy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubts) said: ‘Allâh and His Messenger ([pbuh]) promised us nothing but delusions!" [Al-Qur'an 33:12] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verses go on in the same context to describe the hypocrite as a coward and a defeatist. He is a liar and has no regard for pledges solemnly made. He is treacherous, disloyal, and perfidious. He is niggardly and greedy. In short, he is the complete antithesis of a true believer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They think that Al-Ahzab (the Confederates) have not yet withdrawn, and if Al-Ahzab (the Confederates) should come (again), they would wish they were in the deserts (wandering) among the bedouins, seeking news about you (from a far place); and if they (happen) to be among you, they would not fight but little." [Al-Qur'an 33:20] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All enemies of Islam from the Jews, hypocrites, and polytheists did acknowledge that Islam had the upper hand not because of material superiority, multitudes of troops, or much equipment; but it was rather due to the noble values, refined ethics, and high attributes that imbued the Muslim community and whoever was attached to it. The enemies of Islam were already aware of that flood of light derived wholly from the person of the Prophet (pbuh), who always stood as an excellent exemplar for men to copy and follow.</p>
<p>The enemies of Islam, after steering the course of futile warfare against the new religion for five years, came to realize fully that exterminating Islam is not accessible in the battlefields, so they resorted to other tactics. They, being reputed gossip-mongers, decided to launch a widespread propaganda campaign aiming at slandering the person of the Prophet (pbuh) in a most sensitive area of Arabian life, namely ethics and traditions. Following the battle of the Confederates, the Prophet (pbuh) married Zainab bint Jahsh after her marriage with Zaid bin Haritha, his adopted son, had broken up. They seized this opportunity and began to circulate idle talk against the Prophet (pbuh) in Arabia depending on a tradition among the desert Arabs that prohibits contracting a marriage with an adopted son’s divorcee. They alleged that his marriage would be considered a heinous sin. They also based their malicious propaganda on the fact that Zainab was his fifth wife whereas the number was strictly limited to a maximum of four in the Noble Qur’ân, hence the validity of this marriage was in doubt, according to them.</p>
<p>These rumours and gossips had a negative impact on the morale of some weak-hearted Muslims until the decisive verses were revealed acquitting the Prophet (pbuh) and invalidating all those ill designs and obnoxious schemes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Prophet (Muhammad [pbuh])! Keep your duty to Allâh, and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites (i.e. do not follow their advices). Verily! Allâh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise." [Al-Qur'an 33:1] </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Wicked Role Played During the Ghazwah of Bani Al-Mustaliq</h2>
<p>During this Ghazwah, the hypocrites almost managed to create a sort of discord among the Muslims themselves, coupled with serious and ugly slander against the Prophet (pbuh) himself. In short, their behavior was an authentic translation of Allâh’s Words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing except disorder, and they would have hurried about in your midst (spreading corruption) and sowing sedition among you …" [Al-Qur'an 9:47] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quarrel was about to break out between the Emigrants and the Helpers on account of plots and evil intentions designed by the hypocrites. The Prophet (pbuh) told them off describing their misbehavior as something smacking of pre-Islamic practices. They, hypocrites with ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ubai at their head, were furious for the challenge which the Muslims showed towards the hostile plans and vicious intrigues woven behind closed doors and swore "the most honourable will expel the meanest out of Madinah," and added: "They (the Muslims) have outnumbered and shared us our land. If you fatten your dog, it will eat you." When that talk was reported to the Prophet (pbuh), ‘Umar, a venerable Companion, asked for permission to have Ibn ‘Ubai killed. The Prophet (pbuh) naturally turned down his proposal on the grounds that it did not become of a Prophet (pbuh) to be accused of killing his people. He, on the contrary, in an unexpected move, asked ‘Umar to announce departure. He marched with his men for two days until the sun grew too hot. They stopped and fell asleep, a clever attempt at diverting his people’s attention from the previous event. </p>
<p>‘Abdullah’s son heard of that vile act of his father and as the party reached Madinah, he drew his sword and barred his father’s entry into the town until he had confessed and declared that he himself was the meanest of the citizens of Madinah and the Prophet (pbuh) the most honourable of them. Thus the boast recoiled on his head. It was also reported that the son was ready to kill his father if the Prophet (pbuh) had wanted him to.  </p>
<h3>The Slander Affair</h3>
<p>This extremely painful incident took place on the Prophet’s return from the expedition against Bani Mustaliq. The Muslim army had to halt for a night at a place, a short distance from Madinah. In this expedition, the Prophet (pbuh) was accompanied by his noble and talented wife, ‘Aishah [R]. As it so happened, ‘Aishah [R] went out some distance from the camp to attend to the call of nature. When she returned, she discovered that she had dropped her necklace somewhere. The necklace itself was of no great value, but as it was a loan from a friend, ‘Aishah [R] went out again to search for it. On her return, to her great grief and mortification, the army had already marched away with the camel she was riding, her attendants thinking that she was in the litter as she was then thin, very young and light of weight. In her helplessness she sat down and cried till sleep overpowered her.</p>
<p>Safwan bin Mu‘attal, an Emigrant, who was coming in the rear recognized her as he had seen her before the verse enjoining the veil was revealed, and brought her on his camel to Madinah without saying a single word to her, himself walking behind the animal. The hypocrites of Madinah led by ‘Abdullah bin ‘Ubai bin Salul, sought to make capital out of this incident and spread a malicious scandal against ‘Aishah [R], and unfortunately some of the Muslims also became involved in it. On arrival in Madinah, the Prophet (pbuh) held counsel with his Companions, who pronounced different opinions ranging from divorce to retention. The incident almost roused a fight between two rival factions, Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, but the Prophet’s intervention silenced both parties on the spot. </p>
<p>‘Aishah [R], unaware of the rumours being circulated, fell ill and was confined to bed for a month. On recovering, she heard of the slander and took permission to go and see her parents seeking authentic news. She then burst into tears and stayed for two days and one sleepless night ceaselessly weeping to such an extent that she felt her liver was about to rip open. The Prophet (pbuh) visited her in that situation, and after testifying to the Oneness of Allâh he told her, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If you are innocent, Allâh will acquit you, otherwise, you have to beg for His forgiveness and pardon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She stopped weeping and asked her parents to speak for her, but they had nothing to say, so she herself took the initiative and said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Should I tell you I am innocent, and Allâh knows that I am surely innocent, you will not believe me; and if I were to admit something of which, Allâh knows, I am innocent, you will believe me, then I will have nothing to make recourse to except the words of the father of Prophet Yusuf (Joseph): ‘So (for me) patience is most fitting. And it is Allâh (Alone) Whose Help can be sought against that which you assert." [Al-Qur'an 12:18] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then turned away and lay down for some rest. At that decisive moment the Revelation came acquitting ‘Aishah [R] of all the slanderous talk fabricated in this concern. ‘Aishah [R] of course was wholeheartedly joyful and praised Allâh thankfully. Allâh’s Words in this regard went as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Verily! Those who brought forth the slander (against ‘Aishah [R] — the wife of the Prophet [pbuh]) are a group among you." [Al-Qur'an 24:11] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The principal elements involved in the slander affair, Mistah bin Athatha, Hassan bin Thabit, and Hamnah bint Jahsh, were flogged with eighty stripes. As for the man who took the principal part, ‘Abdullah bin Ubai, he was not flogged, either because the corporal punishment commutes the chastisement in store for him in the Hereafter, and he does not deserve this merit, or for the same public interest for which he was not killed previously. He, moreover, became the butt of reproach and humiliation amongst his people after his real intentions had been unequivocally exposed to all the public. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/364,2/696-698; Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/113-115; Ibn Hisham 2/297-307] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost a month later, the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) and ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab were engaged in the following talk: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don’t you see ‘Umar if I had had him (Abdullah bin Ubai) killed, a large number of dignitaries would have furiously hastened to fight for him. Now, on the contrary, if I ask them to kill him, they will do so out of their own free will."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Umar replied, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I swear by Allâh that the Prophet’s judgement is much more sound than mine." </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Delegations and Expeditions Following Al-Muraisi‘ Ghazwah</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A military expedition led by ‘Abdur Rahman bin ‘Auf was dispatched to the habitation of Bani Kalb in Doumat Al-Jandal in Sha‘ban 6 Hijri. Before setting out, the Prophet (pbuh) summoned ‘Abdur Rahman and placed his hand on the latter’s hand invoking Allâh’s blessings and giving him commandments to act magnanimously during the war. He told him to marry the king’s daughter if they obeyed him. ‘Abdur Rahman stayed among those people for three days, invited them to Islam and they responded positively. He then did marry the king’s daughter Tamadur bint Al-Asbagh. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the same month and year, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib was dispatched at the head of a platoon to the habitation of Bani Sa‘d bin Bakr in a place called Fadk. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) had been reported that those had rallied ranks to support the Jews. The Muslim fighters used to march in the day and lurk at night. On their way, they captured an enemy scout who admitted being sent to Khaibar tribe, to offer them support in return for their dates. ‘Ali and his companions raided their encampment, captured five hundred camels and two thousand goats, but Banu Sa‘d, with their chieftain Wabr bin ‘Aleem had fled away. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An expedition led by Abu Bakr As-Siddiq or Zaid bin Haritha was dispatched to Wadi Al-Qura in Ramadan 6 Hijri after Fazara sept had made an attempt at the Prophet’s life. Following the morning prayer, the detachment was given orders to raid the enemy. Some of them were killed and others captured. Amongst the captives were Umm Qirfa and her beautiful daughter, who was sent to Makkah as a ransom for the release of some Muslim prisoners there. Umm Qirfa’s attempts at the Prophet’s life recoiled on her, and the thirty horsemen she had gathered and sustained to implement her evil scheme were all killed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anas bin Malik reported that some people belonging to the tribe of ‘Uraina came to Allâh’s Messenger (pbuh) and made pretensions to Islam. They stayed in Madinah but found its climate uncongenial, so they were asked to pitch their tents in the pastures nearby. They did so and were all right. They then fell on the Prophet’s shepherd and killed him, turned apostates from Islam and drove off the camels. This news reached the Prophet (pbuh), who sent a group of twenty Muslims led by Karz bin Jabir Al-Fihri on their track. They were brought and handed over to him. He had their hands and feet cut off, their eyes gouged out in recompense for their behavior, and then they were thrown on the stony ground until they died.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/122] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Biographers also reported ‘Amr bin Omaiya Ad-Damari and Salamah bin Abi Salamah to have been sent on an errand to kill Abu Sufyan, the chief of Quraish, who had already sent a bedouin to kill the Prophet (pbuh). The two-men mission failed except for three polytheists killed on the way. It is noteworthy that all the preceding invasions did not imply real bitter fighting; they were rather skirmishes or punitive military maneuvers carried out to deter some enemies still unsubdued. Deep meditation on the development of war circumstances reveals the continuous collapse of the morale among the enemies of Islam, who had come to understand that they were no longer in a position to contain the Islamic call or weaken its active drive. This state of affairs reached its climax in Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty when the two belligerent parties, believers and disbelievers, entered into a truce agreement that pointed markedly to the ever-growing power of Islam, and recorded unequivocally the perpetuity of this heavenly religion in pan-Arabia.</p>
<h1>Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty (Dhul Qa‘dah 6 A.H.)</h1>
<p>When Arabia began to witness the large impressive sweep in favor of the Muslims, the forerunners of the great conquest and success of the Islamic Call started gradually to loom on the demographic horizon, and the true believers restored their undisputed right to observe worship in the sacred sanctuary. </p>
<p>It was about the sixth year Hijri when the Prophet (pbuh) saw in a dream, while he was still in Madinah, that he had entered the sacred sanctuary in Makkah in security with his followers, and was performing the ceremonies of ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). Their heads were being shaved and hair cut off. As soon as he informed some of his Companions of the contents of his dream, their hearts leapt up with joy since they found in it the actualization of their deep longing to take part in pilgrimage and its hallowed rites after an exile of six years. </p>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) had his clothes washed, mounted his camel and marched out towards Makkah at the head of fifteen hundred Muslims including his wife Umm Salamah. Some desert bedouins whose Faith was lukewarm hung back and made excuses. They carried no weapons with them except sheathed swords because they had no intention of fighting. Ibn Umm Maktum was mandated to dispose of the affairs of Madinah during the Prophet’s absence. As they approached Makkah, and in a place called Dhi Hulaifa, he ordered that the sacrificial animals be garlanded, and all believers donned Al-Ihrâm, the pilgrim’s garb. He despatched a reconnoiterer to hunt around for news of the enemy. The man came back to tell the Prophet (pbuh) that a large number of slaves, as well as a huge army, were gathered to oppose him, and that the road to Makkah was completely blocked. </p>
<p>The Quraishites, on their part, held a meeting during which they considered the whole situation and decided to resist the Prophet’s mission at all costs. Two hundred horsemen led by Khalid bin Al-Waleed were despatched to take the Muslims by surprise during Zuhr (the afternoon) prayer. However, the rules of prayer of fear were revealed meanwhile and thus Khalid and his men missed the chance. The Muslims avoided marching on that way and decided to follow a rugged rocky one. Here, Khalid ran back to Quraish to brief them on the latest situation. </p>
<p>When the Muslims reached a spot called Thaniyat Al-Marar, the Prophet’s camel stumbled and knelt down and was too stubborn to move. Muhammad (pbuh) swore he would willingly accede to any plan they put forward that would glorify Allâh’s sanctities. He then reprovingly spurred his camel and it leapt up. They resumed their march and came to pitch their tents at the furthest part of Al-Hudaibiyah beside a well of scanty water. The Muslims reported thirst to the Prophet (pbuh), who took an arrow out of his quiver and placed it in the ditch. Water immediately gushed forth, and his followers drank to their fill. When the Prophet (pbuh) had rested, Budail bin Warqa’ Al-Khuza‘i with some celebrities of Khuza‘ah tribe, the Prophet’s confidants, came and asked him what he had come for. The Prophet (pbuh) replied that it was not for war that he had come forth: "I have no other design," he said, "but to perform ‘Umrah (the lesser pilgrimage) in the Holy Sanctuary. Should Quraish embrace the new religion, as some people have done, they are most welcome, but if they stand in my way or debar the Muslims from pilgrimage, I will surely fight them to the last man, and Allâh’s Order must be fulfilled." The envoy carried the message back to Quraish, who sent another one called Mikraz bin Hafs. On seeing him, the Prophet (pbuh) said that that was a treacherous man. He was given the same message to communicate to his people. He was followed by another ambassador known as Al-Hulais bin ‘Alqamah. He was very much impressed by the spirit of devotion that the Muslims had for the Sacred Ka‘bah. He went back to his men and warned them against debaring Muhammad (pbuh) and his Companions from doing honor to Allâh’s house on the peril of breaking his alliance with them. </p>
<p>Hulais was succeeded by ‘Urwa bin Mas‘ud Ath-Thaqafi to negotiate with Muhammad (pbuh). In the course of discussion, he said to the Prophet (pbuh): "Muhammad! Have you gathered around yourself mixed people and then brought them against your kith and kin in order to destroy them. By Allâh, I think I see you deserted by these people tomorrow." At this point, Abu Bakr stood up and expressed his resentment at this imputation. Al-Mugheerah bin Shu‘bah expressed the same attitude and reprovingly forbade him from touching the Prophet’s beard. Here, Quraish’s envoy remarked indignantly and alluded to the latter’s treacherous act of killing his companions and looting them before he embraced Islam. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, ‘Urwah, during his stay in the Muslim camp, had been closely watching the unfathomable love and profound respect that the followers of Muhammad (pbuh) showed him. He returned and conveyed to Quraish his impression that those people could not forsake the Prophet (pbuh) under any circumstances. He expressed his feelings in the following words: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have been to Chosroes, Caesar and Negus in their kingdoms, but never have I seen a king among a people like Muhammad (pbuh) among his Companions. If he performs his ablution, they would not let the water thereof fall on the ground; if he expectorates, they would have the mucus to rub their faces with; if he speaks, they would lower their voices. They will not abandon him for anything in any case. He, now, offers you a reasonable plan, so do what you please." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing an overwhelming tendency towards reconciliation among their chiefs, some reckless, fight-prone youngsters of Quraish devised a wicked plan that could hinder the peace treaty. They decided to infiltrate into the camp of the Muslims and produce intentional skirmishes that might trigger the fuse of war. Muhammad bin Maslamah, chief of the Muslim guards, took them captive, but in view of the far-reaching imminent results about to be achieved, the Prophet (pbuh) set them free. In this context Allâh says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And He it is Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makkah, after He had made you victors over them." [Al-Qur'an 48:24] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time passed. Negotiations went on but with no results. Then the Prophet (pbuh) desired ‘Umar to see the nobles of Quraish on his behalf. ‘Umar excused himself on account of the personal enmity of Quraish; he had, moreover, no influential relatives in the city who could shield him from danger; and he pointed to ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan, who belonged to one of the most powerful families in Makkah, as the suitable envoy. ‘Uthman went to Abu Sufyan and other chiefs and told them that the Muslims had come only to visit and pay their homage to the Sacred House, to do worship there, and that they had no intention to fight. He was also asked to call them to Islam, and give glad tidings to the believers in Makkah, women and men, that the conquest was approaching and Islam was surely to prevail because Allâh would verily establish His religion in Makkah. </p>
<p>‘Uthman also assured them that after the performance of ceremonies they would soon depart peacefully, but the Quraishites were adamant and not prepared to grant them the permission to visit Al-Ka‘bah. They, however, offered ‘Uthman the permission to perform the pilgrimage, if he so desired in his individual capacity, but ‘Uthman declined the offer saying: "How is it possible that I avail myself of this opportunity, when the Prophet (pbuh) is denied of it?" </p>
<p>The Muslims anxiously waited for the arrival of ‘Uthman with mingled feelings of fear and anxiety. But his arrival was considerably delayed and foul play was suspected on the part of Quraish. The Muslims were greatly worried and took a solemn pledge at the hand of the Prophet (pbuh) that they would sacrifice their lives to avenge the death of their Companion and stand firmly by their master, Muhammad (pbuh), under all conditions. This pledge goes by the name of Bay‘at Ar-Ridwan (a covenant of fealty). The first men to take a pledge were Abu Sinan Al-Asadi and Salamah bin Al-Akwa‘, who gave a solemn promise to die in the cause of Truth three times: at the front of the army, in the middle, and in the rear. The Prophet (pbuh) caught his left hand on behalf of ‘Uthman. This fealty was sworn under a tree, with ‘Umar holding the Prophet’s hand and Ma‘qil bin Yasar holding a branch of the tree up. The Noble Qur’ân has referred to this pledge in the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Indeed, Allâh was pleased with the believers when they gave their Bai‘a (pledge) to you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) under the tree." [Al-Qur'an 48:18] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Quraish saw the firm determination of the Muslims to shed the last drop of blood for the defense of their Faith, they came to their senses and realized that Muhammad’s followers could not be cowed down by these tactics. After some further interchange of messages, they agreed to conclude a treaty of reconciliation and peace with the Muslims. The clauses of the said treaty go as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Muslims shall return this time and come back next year, but they shall not stay in Makkah for more than three days.</li>
<li>They shall not come back armed but can bring with them swords only sheathed in scabbards and these shall be kept in bags.</li>
<li>War activities shall be suspended for ten years, during which both parties will live in full security and neither will raise sword against the other.</li>
<li>If anyone from Quraish goes over to Muhammad (pbuh) without his guardian’s permission, he should be sent back to Quraish, but should any of Muhammad’s followers return to Quraish, he shall not be sent back.</li>
<li>Whosoever wishes to join Muhammad (pbuh), or enter into treaty with him, should have the liberty to do so; and likewise whosoever wishes to join Quraish, or enter into treaty with them, should be allowed to do so. </li>
</ol>
<p>Some dispute arose with regard to the preamble. For example, when the agreement was to be committed to writing, ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, who acted as a scribe began with the words: Bismillâh ir-Rahman ir-Raheem, i.e., "In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful" but the Makkan plenipotentiary, Suhail bin ‘Amr, declared that he knew nothing about Ar-Rahman and insisted upon the customary formula Bi-ismika Allâhumma, i.e., "In Your Name, O Allâh!" The Muslims grumbled with uneasiness but the Prophet (pbuh) agreed. He then went on to dictate, "This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh has agreed to with Suhail bin ‘Amr." Upon this, Suhail again protested: "Had we acknowledged you as Prophet, we would not have debarred you from the Sacred House, nor fought against you. Write your own name and the name of your father." The Muslims grumbled as before and refused to consent to the change. The Prophet (pbuh), however, in the larger interest of Islam, attached no importance to such an insignificant detail, erased the words himself, and dictated instead: "Muhammad, the son of ‘Abdullah." </p>
<p>Soon after this treaty, Khuza‘a clan, a former ally of Banu Hashim, joined the ranks of Muhammad (pbuh), and Banu Bakr sided with Quraish. It was during this time while the treaty was being written that Abu Jandal, Suhail’s son, appeared on the scene. He was brutally chained and was staggering with privation and fatigue. The Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions were moved to pity and tried to secure his release, but Suhail was adamant and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To signify that you are faithful to your contract, an opportunity has just arrived."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But the treaty was not signed when your son entered the camp."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon this, he burst forth and said, "but the terms of the treaty were agreed upon." It was indeed an anxious moment. On the one hand, Abu Jandal was lamenting at the top of his voice, "Am I to be returned to the polytheists that they might entice me from my religion, O Muslims!" but, on the other hand, the faithful engagement was also considered to be necessary, above all other considerations. The Prophet’s heart welled up with sympathy, but he wanted to honour his word at all costs. He consoled Abu Jandal and said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Be patient, resign yourself to the Will of Allâh. Allâh is going to provide for you and your helpless companions relief and means of escape. We have concluded a treaty of peace with them and we have taken the pledge in the Name of Allâh. We are, therefore, under no circumstances prepared to break it." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Umar bin Al-Khattab could not help giving vent to the deep-seated agony of his heart. He rose to his feet uttering words implying deep hatred and extreme indignation and requested Abu Jandal to take his sword and kill Suhail, but the son spared his father. However, in silent resignation was therefore, Abu Jandal borne away with his chains. </p>
<p>When the peace treaty had been concluded, the Prophet (pbuh) ordered his Companions to slaughter their sacrificial animals, but they were too depressed to do that. The Prophet (pbuh) gave instructions in this regard three times but with negative response. He told his wife Umm Salamah about this attitude of his Companions. She advised that he himself take the initiative, slaughter his animal and have his head shaved. Seeing that, the Muslims, with rended hearts, started to slaughter their animals and shave their heads. They even almost killed one another because of their distress. The Prophet (pbuh) prayed three times for those who shaved their heads and once for those who cut their hair. A camel was sacrificed on behalf of seven men and a cow on behalf of the same number of people. The Prophet (pbuh) sacrificed a camel which once belonged to Abu Jahl and which the Muslims had seized as booty at Badr, thus enraging the polytheists. </p>
<p>During Al-Hudaibiyah campaign, the Prophet (pbuh) permitted Ka‘b bin ‘Ujrah, who was in a state of Ihram (state of ritual consecration of the pilgrim) for ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) to shave his head due to illness, on the condition that he will pay compensation by sacrificing a sheep, fasting for three days, or feeding six needy persons. Concerning this, the following verse was revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either fasting (three days) or giving Sadaqa (feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)." [Al-Qur'an 2:196] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, some believing women emigrated to Madinah and asked the Prophet (pbuh) for refuge which they were granted. When their families demanded their return, he would not hand them back because the following verse was revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them, Allâh knows best as to their Faith, then if you know them for true believers, send them not back to the disbelievers, they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them. But give the disbelievers that (amount of money) which they have spent [as their Mahr] to them. And there will be no sin on you to marry them if you have paid their Mahr to them. Likewise hold not the disbelieving women as wives …" [Al-Qur'an 60:10] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why the believing women were not handed back was either because they were not originally included in the terms of the treaty, which mentioned only men, or because the Qur’ân abrogated any terms dealing with women in the verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O Prophet! When believing women come to you to give you the Bai‘a (Pledge), that they will not associate anything in worship with Allâh …" [Al-Qur'an 60:12] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the verse which forbade Muslim women from marrying disbelieving men. Likewise, Muslim men were commanded to terminate their marriages to disbelieving women. In compliance with this injunction, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab divorced two wives he had married before he embraced Islam; Mu‘awiyah married the first woman, and Safwan bin Omaiyah married the second.  </p>
<h3>Al-Hudaibiyah Treaty: Socio-political Impact</h3>
<p>A series of events confirmed the profound wisdom and splendid results of the peace treaty which Allâh called "a manifest victory". How could it be otherwise when Quraish had recognized the legitimate Muslims’ existence on the scene of political life in Arabia, and began to deal with the believers on equal terms? Quraish, in the light of the articles of the treaty, had indirectly relinquished its claim to religious leadership and admitted that they were no longer interested in people other than Quraish, and washed their hands of any sort of intervention in the religious future of the Arabian Peninsula. </p>
<p>The Muslims did not have in mind to seize people’s property or kill them through bloody wars, nor did they ever think of pursuing any coercive approaches in their endeavours to propagate Islam; on the contrary, their sole target was to provide an atmosphere of freedom as regards ideology or religion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve." [Al-Qur'an 18:29] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Muslims, on the other hand, had the opportunity to spread Islam over areas not then explored. When there was armistice, war was abolished, and men met and consulted together, none talked about Islam intelligently without entering it; within the two years following the conclusion of the treaty, double as many entered Islam as ever before. This is supported by the fact that the Prophet (pbuh) went out to Al-Hudaibiyah with only 1,400 men, but when he set out to liberate Makkah, two years later, he had 10,000 men with him.</p>
<p>The article of the treaty pertaining to the cessation of hostilities for ten years points directly to the utter failure of political haughtiness exercised by Quraish and its allies, and functions as evidence of the collapse and impotence of the war instigator. Quraish had been obliged to lose those advantages in return for one seemingly in its favor but does not actually bear any harm against the Muslims, i.e., the article that speaks of handing over believing men who seek refuge with the Muslims without their guardians’ consent to Quraish. At first glance, it was a most distressing clause and was considered objectionable in the Muslim camp. However, in the course of events, it proved to be a great blessing. </p>
<p>The Muslims sent back to Makkah were not likely to renounce the blessings of Islam; contrariwise, those very Muslims turned out to be centres of influence for Islam. It was impossible to think that they would become apostates or renegades. The wisdom behind this truce assumed its full dimensions in some subsequent events. After the Prophet (pbuh) had reached Madinah, Abu Baseer, who had escaped from Quraish, came to him as a Muslim; Quraish sent two men demanding his return, so the Prophet (pbuh) handed him over to them. On the way to Makkah, Abu Baseer managed to kill one of them, and the other one fled to Madinah with Abu Baseer in pursuit. When he reached the Prophet (pbuh), he said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your obligation is over and Allâh has freed you from it. You duly handed me over to the men, and Allâh has rescued me from them." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) said, "Woe is his mother, he would have kindled a war if there had been others with him." When he heard that, he knew that he would be handed back to them, so he fled from Madinah and went as far as Saif Al-Bahr. The other Muslims who were oppressed in Makkah began to escape to Abu Baseer. He was joined by Abu Jandal and others until a fair-sized colony was formed and soon sought revenge on Quraish and started to intercept their caravans. </p>
<p>The pagans of Makkah, finding themselves unable to control those exiled colonists, begged the Prophet (pbuh) to do away with the clause which governed the extradition. They implored him by Allâh and by their ties of kinship to send for the group, saying that whoever joined the Muslims in Madinah would be safe from them. So the Prophet (pbuh) sent for the group and they responded, as expected, positively. </p>
<p>These are the realities of the clauses of the truce treaty and as it seems they all function in favor of the nascent Islamic state. However, two points in the treaty made it distasteful to some Muslims. Namely, they were not given access to the Holy Sanctuary that year, and the seemingly humiliating attitude as regards reconciliation with the pagans of Quraish. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Umar, unable to contain himself for the distress taking full grasp of his heart, went to the Prophet (pbuh) and said: "Aren’t you the true Messenger of Allâh?" The Prophet (pbuh) replied calmly, "Why not?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Umar again spoke and asked: "Aren’t we on the path of righteousness and our enemies in the wrong?" Without showing any resentment, the Prophet (pbuh) replied that it was so. On getting this reply he further urged: "Then we should not suffer any humiliation in the matter of Faith." The Prophet (pbuh) was unruffled and with perfect confidence said: "I am the true Messenger of Allâh, I never disobey Him, He shall help me." </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Did you not tell us," rejoined ‘Umar, "that we shall perform pilgrimage?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"But I have never told you," replied the Prophet (pbuh), "that we shall do so this very year." </p>
<p>‘Umar was silenced. But his mind was disturbed. He went to Abu Bakr and expressed his feelings before him. Abu Bakr, who had never been in doubt as regards the Prophet’s truthfulness and veracity confirmed what the Prophet (pbuh) had told him. </p>
<p>In due course, the Chapter of Victory (48th) was revealed saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad [pbuh]) a manifest victory." [Al-Qur'an 48:1] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) summoned ‘Umar and imported to him the happy tidings. ‘Umar was overjoyed and greatly regretted his former attitude. He used to spend in charity, observe fasting and prayer and free as many slaves as possible in expiation for that reckless attitude he had assumed. </p>
<p>The early part of the year 7 A.H. witnessed the Islamization of three prominent men of Makkah, ‘Amr bin Al-‘As, Khalid bin Al-Waleed, and ‘Uthman bin Talhah. On their arrival and entrance into the fold of Islam, the Prophet (pbuh) said, "Quraish has given us its own blood."</p>
<h2>The Second Stage: A New Phase of Islamic Action</h2>
<p>Al-Hudaibiyah Truce marked a new phase in the process of Islamic action and life of the Muslims. Quraish, a bitter enemy of Islam, now withdraws from the war arena and embraces a peaceful settlement with the Muslims. Thus, the third support of a tripartite enemy (Quraish, Ghatfan, and the Jews) is broken, and being the holder of the banner of paganism in Arabia, the other pagans’ aggressive feelings towards Islam considerably subsided. Ghatfan Tribe no longer constituted any remarkable threat, and their provocative deeds were mainly Jewish-instigated actions. </p>
<p>The Jews, after being banished from Madinah, resorted to Khaibar to change it into a hotbed of intrigues against the Prophet (pbuh). There, they used to hatch their plots, ignite the fire of dissension, and allure the Arabs living in the vicinity of Madinah to join them with the aim of exterminating the new Islamic state, or at least inflict heavy losses on the Muslims. </p>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh), not heedless of their devilish schemes, placed a decisive war with them as a first priority on his agenda shortly after the endorsement of the above-mentioned treaty. The treaty of Hudaibiyah allowed the Muslims to intensify their Islamic career and double up their ceaseless efforts in propagating their Da‘wah, and consequently give this sort of action preponderance over the military activities. Hence, we deem it imperative to divide this post-treaty stage into two sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ceaseless peaceful efforts in propagating the Islamic Da‘wah (Call) and initiating a sort of correspondence with kings and princes of the neighboring political entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Military activities. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Prophet’s Plans to Spread the Message of Islam Beyond Arabia</h2>
<p>Late in the sixth year A.H., on his return from Hudaibiyah, the Prophet (pbuh) decided to send messages to the kings beyond Arabia calling them to Islam. In order to authenticate the credentials of his envoys, a silver seal was made in which were graven the words: "Muhammad the Messenger of Allâh" in the following formation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Sahih Al-Bukhari 2/872,873] 
[Picture not given right now - will be added later] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Envoys were chosen on the basis of their experience and knowledge, and sent on their errands in Muharram in the year 7 A.H., a few days before heading for Khaibar. </p>
<h3>1. A Deputation to Abyssinia (Ethiopia)</h3>
<p>Negus, king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), his name was Ashama bin Al-Abjar, received the Prophet’s message, dispatched by Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari, which At-Tabari referred to, either late in the sixth year or early in the seventh year A.H. Deep scrutiny into the letter shows that it was not the one sent after Al-Hudaibiyah event. Wording of the letter rather indicates that it was sent to that king when Ja‘far and his companions emigrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) during the Makkan period. One of its sentences read: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have despatched my cousin, Ja‘far with a group of Muslims, to you. Do be generous towards them and give up haughtiness." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-Baihaqi, on the authority of Ibn Ishaq, gave the following narration of the Prophet’s letter sent to Negus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This letter is sent from Muhammad, the Prophet to Negus Al-Ashama, the king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Peace be upon him who follows true guidance and believes in Allâh and His Messenger. I bear witness that there is no god but Allâh Alone with no associate, He has taken neither a wife nor a son, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. I call you unto the fold of Islam; if you embrace Islam, you will find safety, "Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allâh, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh.’ Then, if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’" [Al-Qur'an 3:64] </p>
<p>Should you reject this invitation, then you will be held responsible for all the evils of the Christians of your people." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Hameedullah (Paris), a reliable verifier, has adduced a version of the above letter disclosed only a short time ago and identical to Ibn Al-Qaiyim’s narration. Dr. Hameedullah exerted painstaking effort and used all means of modern technology to verify the text of the letter, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad the Messenger of Allâh to Negus, king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Peace be upon him who follows true guidance. Salutations, I entertain Allâh’s praise, there is no god but He, the Sovereign, the Holy, the Source of peace, the Giver of peace, the Guardian of faith, the Preserver of safety. I bear witness that Jesus, the son of Mary, is the spirit of Allâh and His Word which He cast into Mary, the virgin, the good, the pure, so that she conceived Jesus. Allâh created him from His spirit and His breathing as He created Adam by His Hand. I call you to Allâh Alone with no associate and to His obedience and to follow me and to believe in that which came to me, for I am the Messenger of Allâh. I invite you and your men to Allâh, the Glorious, the All-Mighty. I hereby bear witness that I have communicated my message and advice. I invite you to listen and accept my advice. Peace be upon him who follows true guidance." </p>
<p>[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/60] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text of this letter is doubtlessly authentic, but to maintain that it was written after the Al-Hudaibiyah event is still a question lacking in definite evidence. </p>
<p>When ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damari communicated the Apostolic letter to Negus, the latter took the parchment and placed it on his eye, descended to the floor, confessed his faith in Islam, and wrote the following reply to the Prophet (pbuh):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. 
From Negus Ashama to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh. Peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allâh! and mercy and blessing from Allâh beside Whom there is no god. I have received your letter in which you have mentioned about Jesus and by the Lord of heaven and earth, Jesus is not more than what you say. We fully acknowledge that with which you have been sent to us and we have entertained your cousin and his companions. I bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allâh, true and confirming (those who have gone before you), I pledge to you through your cousin and surrender myself through him to the Lord of the worlds." </p>
<p>[Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/61] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) had asked Negus to send Ja‘far and his companions, the emigrants to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), back home. They came back to see the Prophet (pbuh) in Khaibar. Negus later died in Rajab 9 A.H. shortly after Tabuk Ghazwa. The Prophet (pbuh) announced his death and observed prayer in absentia for him. Another king succeeded Negus to the throne and another letter was sent to him by the Prophet (pbuh), but whether or not he embraced Islam is still a question not answered yet. </p>

<h3>2. Letter to the Vicegerent of Egypt, Called Muqawqas</h3>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) wrote to Juraij bin Matta [Rahmat-al-lil'alameen 1/178; Dr. Hamidullah said that his name was Binyamin], called Muqawqas, vicegerent of Egypt and Alexandria saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad slave of Allâh and His Messenger to Muqawqas, vicegerent of Egypt. Peace be upon him who follows true guidance. Thereafter, I invite you to accept Islam. Therefore, if you want security, accept Islam. If you accept Islam, Allâh, the Sublime, shall reward you doubly. But if you refuse to do so, you will bear the burden of the transgression of all the Copts. </p>
<p>"Say (O Muhammad ([pbuh]: ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allâh, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh.’ Then, if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’" [Al-Qur'an 3:64] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hatib bin Abi Balta‘a, who was chosen to communicate the message, requested an audience with Muqawqas before imparting the contents of the letter. He addressed Egypt’s vicegerent saying: "There used to be someone before you who had arrogated the status of the Supreme Lord, so Allâh punished him and made an example of him in the Hereafter, and in this life; therefore, take warning and never set a bad example to others." Muqawqas answered: "We are in no position to relinquish our religion except for a better one." </p>
<p>Hatib resumed: "We invite you to embrace Islam, which will suffice you for all that you may lose. Our Prophet has called people to profess this Faith, Quraish and the Jews stood against him as bitter enemies, whereas Christians stood closest to his Call. Upon my life, Moses’s news about Christ is identical to the latter’s good tidings about the advent of Muhammad; likewise, this invitation of ours to you to embrace Islam is similar to your invitation to the people of Torah to accept the New Testament. Once a Prophet rises in a nation, he is eligible for positive response; hence you are subject to the same Divine Law. Bear in mind that we have not come to dissuade you from the religion of Christ but rather bidding you to adhere to its tenets." </p>
<p>Muqawqas meditated over the contents of the letter deeply and said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have come to the conviction that this Prophet bids nothing abominable; he is neither a straying magician nor a lying soothsayer. He bears the true manifest seeds of Prophethood, and so I will consider the affair deeply." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He took the parchment and ordered that it be kept in an ivory casket. He called a scribe to write the following reply in Arabic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. From Muqawqas to Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah. Peace be upon you. I have read your letter and understood its contents, and what you are calling for. I already know that the coming of a Prophet is still due, but I used to believe he would be born in Syria. I am sending you as presents two maids, who come from noble Coptic families; clothing and a steed for riding on. Peace be upon you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that Muqawqas did not avail himself of this priceless opportunity and he did not embrace Islam. The presents were accepted; Maria, the first maid, stayed with the Prophet (pbuh), and gave birth to his son Ibrahîm; the other Sirin was given to Hassan bin Thabit Al-Ansari. </p>
<h3>3. A Letter to Chosroes, Emperor of Persia</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh to Chosroes, king of Persia. Peace be upon him who follows true guidance, believes in Allâh and His Messenger and testifies that there is no god but Allâh Alone with no associate, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. I invite you to accept the religion of Allâh. I am the Messenger of Allâh sent to all people in order that I may infuse fear of Allâh in every living person, and that the charge may be proved against those who reject the Truth. Accept Islam as your religion so that you may live in security; otherwise, you will be responsible for all the sins of the Magians." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Abdullah bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi was chosen to carry the letter. This envoy carried it to the king of Bahrain but we do not know as yet if the latter sent it to Chosroes by one of his men or chose ‘Abdullah himself. The proud monarch was enraged by the style of the letter as the name of the Prophet (pbuh) had been put above his own name. He tore the letter into shreds and forthwith dictated a command to his viceroy in Yemen to send a couple of troopers to arrest the Prophet and bring him to his presence. The governor, Bazan by name, immediately sent two men to Madinah for the purpose. As soon as the men reached Madinah, the Prophet (pbuh) was informed by a Divine Revelation that Pervez, the emperor of Persia, had been murdered by his son. The Prophet (pbuh) disclosed to them the news and they were stunned. He added asking them to tell their new monarch that Islam would prevail everywhere and outstrip the sovereignty of Chosroes himself. They hurried back to Bazan and communicated to him what they heard. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sherweh, the new monarch sent a letter to Bazan confirming the news and bidding him to stop any procedures as regards the Prophet until further notice. Bazan, together with the Persians in Yemen, went into the folds of Islam, and gladly signified his adhesion to the Prophet. </p>

<h3>4. The Envoy to Caesar, King of Rome</h3>
<p>Al-Bukhari gave a long narration of the contents of the letter sent by the Prophet (pbuh) to Hercules, king of the Byzantines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the slave of Allâh and His Messenger to Hercules, king of the Byzantine. Blessed are those who follow true guidance. I invite you to embrace Islam so that you may live in security. If you come within the fold of Islam, Allâh will give you double reward, but in case you turn your back upon it, then the burden of the sins of all your people shall fall on your shoulders. </p>
<p>"Say (O Muhammad [pbuh]): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), come to a word that is just between us and you: that we worship none but Allâh, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh.’ Then, if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’" [Al-Qur'an 3:64][Sahih Al-Bukhari 1/4,5] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Muslim envoy, Dihyah bin Khalifah Al-Kalbi, was ordered to hand the letter over to the king of Busra, who would in turn send it to Caesar. Incidentally, Abu Sufyan bin Harb, who by that time had not embraced Islam, was summoned to the court and Hercules asked him many questions about Muhammad (pbuh) and the religion which he preached. The testimony which this avowed enemy of the Prophet gave regarding the personal excellence of the Prophet’s character and the good that Islam was doing to the human race, left Hercules wonder-struck. </p>
<p>Al-Bukhâri, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, narrated that Hercules sent for Abu Sufyan and his companions, who happened to be trading in Ash-Sham, Jerusalem. That was during the truce that had been concluded between the polytheists of Quraish and the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh). Hercules, seated amongst his chiefs of staff, asked, "Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a Prophet?" "I (Abu Sufyan) replied: ‘I am the nearest relative to him from amongst the group.’ So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him): ‘Tell them (i.e., Abu Sufyan’s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e., Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a Prophet. So if he tells a lie, they should contradict him (instantly)’. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By Allâh had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies," Abu Sufyan later said. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abu Sufyan’s testimony went as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Muhammad descends from a noble family. No one of his family happened to assume kingship. His followers are those deemed weak with numbers ever growing. He neither tells lies nor betrays others, we fight him and he fights us but with alternate victory. He bids people to worship Allâh Alone with no associate, and abandon our fathers’ beliefs. He orders us to observe prayer, honesty, abstinence, and maintain strong family ties." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hercules, on hearing this testimony, turned to his translator bidding him to communicate to us his following impression which reveals full conviction in the truthfulness of Muhammad’s Prophethood: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I fully realize that Prophets come from noble families; he does not affect any previous example of Prophethood. Since none of his ancestors was a monarch, we cannot then allege that he is a man trying to reclaim his father’s monarchy. So long as he does not tell lies to people, he is for the more reason, immune to telling lies as regards Allâh. Concerning his followers being those deemed weak with numbers ever growing, it is something that goes in agreement with questions of Faith until this latter assumes its full dimensions geographically and demographically. </p>
<p>"I have understood that no instance of apostasy has as yet appeared among his followers, and this points to the bliss of Faith that finds its abode in the human heart. Betrayal, as I see, is alien to him because real Prophets hold betrayal in abhorrence. Bidding worship of Allâh with no associates, observance of prayer, honesty, and abstinence, and prohibition of paganism are traits bound to subject to him all my possessions. I have already known that a Prophet must arise but it has never occurred to me that he will be an Arab from among you. If I was sure I would be faithful to him, I might hope to meet him, and if I were with him, I would wash his feet." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hercules then requested that the Prophet’s letter be read. The observations of the emperor, and finally the definite and clear-cut exposition of the Islamic message could not but create a tense atmosphere amongst the clergy present at the court. We were ordered to go out." Abu Sufyan said, "While coming out, I said to my companions, ‘The matter of Ibn Abi Kabshah (i.e., Muhammad [pbuh]) has become so prominent that even the king of Banu Al-Asfar (i.e., the Romans) is afraid of him.’ So I continued to believe that Allâh’s Messenger (pbuh) would be victorious, till Allâh made me embrace Islam." </p>
<p>The king did not embrace Islam — for it was differently ordained. However, the Muslim envoy was returned to Madinah with the felicitations of the emperor. </p>
<p>On his way back to Madinah, Dihyah Al-Kalbi was intercepted by people from Judham tribe in Hasmi, who looted the presents sent to the Prophet (pbuh). Zaid bin Haritha at the head of five hundred men was despatched to that spot, inflicted heavy losses on those people, and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle, and a hundred women and boys. The chief of Judham who had embraced Islam filed a complaint with the Prophet, who gave a positive response to the former’s protest and ordered that all the spoils and captives be returned. </p>
<h3>5. A Letter to Mundhir bin Sawa, Governor of Bahrain</h3>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) despatched ‘Al-‘Ala’ bin Al-Hadrami to the governor of Bahrain, carrying a letter inviting him to embrace Islam. In reply, Al-Mundhir bin Sawa wrote the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allâh’s Messenger (pbuh)! I received your injunctions. Prior to this, I read your letter, which you wrote to the people of Bahrain extending to them an invitation to Islam. Islam appealed to some of them and they entered the fold of Islam, while others did not find it appealing. In my country, there live Magians and Jews, and therefore you may inform me of the treatment to be extended to them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet (pbuh) wrote the following letter in reply to his:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Mundhir bin Sawa. Peace be on you! I praise Allâh with no associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. Thereafter, I remind you of Allâh, the Mighty, the Glorious. Whoever accepts admonition does it for his own good. Whoever follows my messengers and acts in accordance with their guidance, he, in fact, accepts my advice. </p>
<p>"My messengers have highly praised your behaviour. You shall continue in your present office. Give the new Muslims full chance to preach their religion. I accept your recommendation regarding the people of Bahrain, and I pardon the offences of the offenders; therefore, you may also forgive them. Of the people of Bahrain whoever wants to go on in their Jewish or Magian faith, should be made to pay Jizya (poll-tax)." [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/61,62]   </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>6. A Letter to Haudha bin ‘Ali, Governor of Yamama</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Haudha bin ‘Ali. Peace be upon him who follows true guidance. Be informed that my religion shall prevail everywhere. You should accept Islam, and whatever under your command shall remain yours." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The envoy chosen was Sulait bin ‘Amr Al-‘Amiri, who after communicating his message, carried back the following reply to the Prophet (pbuh):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Faith, to which you invite me, is very good. I am a famous orator and poet, the Arabs highly respect me and I am of account among them. If you include me in your government, I am prepared to follow you." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The governor then bestowed a reward on Sulait and presented him with clothes made of Hajr fabric. Of course, he put all those presents in the trust of the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophet (pbuh) did not accept Haudha’s demand. He usually turned down such peremptory tone and would say that the whole matter was in the Hand of Allâh, Who gave His land to whoever He desired. </p>
<p>Gabriel later came with the Revelation that Haudha had died. The Prophet (pbuh), in the context of his comment on this news, said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yamama is bound to give rise to a liar who will arrogate Prophethood to himself but he will subsequently be killed." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply to a question relating to the identity of the killer, the Prophet said, "It is one of you, followers of Islam." [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/63] </p>
<h3>7. A Letter to Harith bin Abi Shamir Al-Ghassani, King of Damascus</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad, Messenger of Allâh to Al-Harith bin Abi Shamir. Peace be upon him who follows true guidance, believes in it, and regards it as true. I invite you to believe in Allâh Alone with no associate; thenceforth your kingdom will remain yours." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shuja‘ bin Wahab had the honour of taking the letter to Harith, who upon hearing the letter read in his audience, was madly infuriated and uttered: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who dares to dispossess me of my country? I’ll fight him (the Prophet)," </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and arrogantly rejected the Prophet’s invitation to the fold of Islam. [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 3/62; Muhadarat Tareekh Al-Umam Al-Islamiyah 1/146] </p>
<h3>8. A Letter to the King of ‘Oman, Jaifer, and his Brother ‘Abd Al-Jalandi</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad bin ‘Abdullah to Jaifer and ‘Abd Al-Jalandi." </p>
