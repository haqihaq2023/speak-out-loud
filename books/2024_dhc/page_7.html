<h4>Summary of Preceding Text</h4>
<p>The text discusses various trials faced by the Prophet Yisuf (Joseph), highlighting the theme of envy and oppression stemming from the jealousy of his brothers. It references Surah Al-Baqarah (2:109), which speaks about the negative emotions that can lead individuals to turn away from the truth. The brothers' jealousy towards Yisuf is evident, particularly in their claim that he and his brother are loved more by their father. This jealousy motivates them to plot against Yisuf, leading to his eventual abandonment in a well and sale into slavery. The narrative emphasizes the harm that can arise from envy, creating a backdrop for Yisuf's resilience amid suffering.</p>

<p>Additionally, Yisuf faces moral challenges, particularly regarding seduction by his master’s wife, as depicted in Surah Yaisuf (12:5). Instead of succumbing to temptation, Yisuf opts for imprisonment as a form of self-preservation in his faith. This illustrates a profound moral lesson on the importance of prioritizing one's duty to Allah over worldly desires and the consequences that may follow as a result. The text suggests that true patience is exemplified by individuals facing trials through their own volition, as Yisuf did. His ability to endure and remain righteous under pressure demonstrates a higher standard of endurance compared to passive suffering.</p>

<p>The discussion draws parallels between Yisuf's experiences and those faced by believers who stand firm in their faith despite societal pressures and persecution. It underscores the significance of choosing obedience to Allah, even when it results in personal harm or loss. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) faced similar trials but with greater ramifications, as his steadfastness often invoked violent backlash from disbelievers. The text culminates in a reminder of the rewards for those who endure hardships due to their faith, suggesting that while all acts of patience are commendable, those driven by conscious choices in the pursuit of righteousness carry greater merit in the eyes of Allah.</p>

<h3>Patiently Enduring Trials</h3>
<p>The patient through-out this was a patience that arose out of his own volition, and indeed he was harmed in this way only that he may do what he did out of his own choice. So this patience of his was greater than the patience of Yusuf, for only an indecent action was sought from Yusuf, and he was only punished by imprisonment when he did not comply. But disbelief was sought from the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions, and when they did not do this, then they were punished by being slaughtered and other such harms - the least of which was imprisonment, for the polytheists imprisoned him and Bani Hashim for a time in a mountain pass. Then when Abu Talib died they became more severe against him, and when the Ansar gave him the pledge of allegiance and when the polytheists came to know of this they tried to prevent him from leaving (for Madinah) and tried to detain him and his Companions. Then all of them emigrated secretly except for Umar bin al-Khattab and those like him.</p>

<p>So what befell the believers came about as a result of their choosing obedience to Allah and His Messenger and it was not from the afflictions that occur without the servant’s choice of the type that Yusuf was tried with, nor of the type of his being separated from his father. So this patience endured by the believers was the nobler of the two types of patience, and its possessors are greater with respect to ranking. This, even though the one who is tried without his will shall be rewarded for his patience and his contentment with the decree of Allah, and his sins will be expiated. As for the person who is tried and harmed for choosing obedience to Allah, then he will be rewarded for the actual trial and it shall be written as a righteous action for him. Allah, the Most High, said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"That is because they suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of Allah, nor do they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but it is written to their credit as a righteous deed. Indeed Allah wastes not the reward of the doers of good." (Surah At-Tawbah (9): 120)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This contrasts with the case of the one who is tried without his choice, such as being sick, or death, or a thief stealing from him - this person shall be rewarded for his patience only, not for the actual trial itself and what results from it. As for those who are harmed due to their faith in Allah and obedience to Him and His Messenger, and as a result of this they are in pain, or are sick, or are imprisoned, or are forced to leave their land, or their property and family is taken from them, or are beaten and abused, or their position and wealth is diminished, then in this they are upon the way of the Prophets and those that followed them, such as the Muhajirin.</p>

<p>So these people shall be rewarded for what has harmed them, and a righteous action shall be written for them due to it just as the mujahid shall be rewarded for the hunger, thirst, and fatigue that afflicts him, and for enraging the disbelievers even if these effects are not something he has physically set out to do, but they are resultant from his action (of performing jihad) that he has chosen to do. The people have differed over this: can it be said that these resultant effects are actions of the actor of the reason for these effects, or are they Actions of Allah, or is there no actor for them? What is correct is that they are shared between the actor of the reason and the (Actor of the) totality of the reasons, and this is why a righteous action is written for him.</p>

<h3>The Cure for Jealousy</h3>
<p>The purpose behind this discussion is that jealousy is one of the sicknesses of the soul, and it is an illness that afflicts the generality of mankind, and only a few are secure from it. This is why it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The body is never free from jealousy, but debasement brings it out, and nobility hides it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was said to al-Hasan al-Basri, "Can a believer be envied?" He replied, "What has made you forget Yusuf and his brothers, have you no father?" But you should keep (this envy should it occur) blinded in your heart, for you cannot be harmed by that which you did not act upon in speech or action.</p>

<p>So the one who finds that he harbors jealousy in his soul towards someone else, then it is upon him to treat it with patience and tawakkul (trust) in Allah, and dislike it being in his soul. Many religious people do not take a stance against the one who is envied and neither do they help the one who would oppress him, but neither do they establish what is obligatory with respect to his rights. Rather when someone censures the one who is envied they do not agree with or aid him in the censure but neither do they mention his praiseworthy qualities. Likewise, if someone were to praise him, they remain silent. So these people are responsible for their leaving what is commanded with respect to the rights of the envied, and they have exceeded the proper bounds in this even though they may not have taken a stance against him. The reward of these people is that their rights in turn will be neglected and on some occasions they will not be treated fairly, and neither will they be helped against the one who oppresses them, just as they did not aid the envied who was oppressed. As for the one who actually takes a stance against the envied, either with words or actions then he will be punished for this, and the one who fears Allah and is patient and does not become one of the oppressors - Allah will benefit him for his sabr (patience).</p>

<h3>The Causes for Jealousy</h3>
<p>This is what occurred with Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) for she used to be one who would vie with A'ishah from the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ). The jealousy displayed by some women to others is great, and is especially true of those who are married to one husband. The woman will go to great extents to get her allotted time from him for sometimes some of her allotted time will be missed due to his sharing with other wives. This jealousy commonly occurs among those that share authority or property in the case when some of them take a share from it and others are left with none. It also occurs between those that debate, due to their hatred that their opponent gets the better of them, such as the jealousy of the brothers of Yusuf, or the jealousy of the two sons of Adam one to the other; in this case, the brother was envied by the other due to Allah accepting his sacrifice and not the other’s, which led to his murder. Also, the jealousy displayed towards the Muslims by the Jews. It was said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The first sins by which Allah was disobeyed were three: covetousness, arrogance, and jealousy. Covetousness was displayed by Adam, arrogance by Iblis, and jealousy from Qabil when he killed Habil."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the hadith, there occurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are three sins from which no one can be saved: jealousy, suspicion, and omens. Shall I tell you of what would remove you from this: when you envy then do not hate, when you are suspicious then do not actualize your suspicions, and when you see omens then ignore them."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reported by Ibn Abi ad-Dunya from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him).</p>

<p>In the Sahihs from the Prophet (ﷺ):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You have been afflicted with the illness of the nations that came before you - jealousy and hatred. They are the shearers; I do not mean shearers of the hair, rather they are shearers of the religion."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he called jealousy an illness just as he called miserliness an illness in his saying, "And what illness is worse than miserliness?"</p>

<p>And in another hadith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I seek refuge with You from the evil morals and manners, vain desires, and illnesses."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mentioning illnesses alongside manners and vain desires. Manners are those things that the soul becomes accustomed to such that they become its nature and disposition. Allah said in this regard:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And indeed you are upon an exalted standard of character." (Surah Al-Qalam (68): 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ibn Abbas, Ibn Uyaynah, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allah be pleased with them) said in commentary to this: meaning ‘upon a great religion.’ And in a variant wording of Ibn Abbas: "The religion of Islam." This was similarly stated by A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her): "His manners were the Qur'an," and Hasan al-Basri said, "The manners of the Qur'an is ‘the exalted standard of character.’"</p>

<p>As for ‘vain desires’ then they are temporary anomalous conditions, and ‘illness’ is sickness - this is an affliction that harms the heart and corrupts it. In the first hadith, jealousy was mentioned along with hatred. This is because the envier, first of all, dislikes the bounty bestowed by Allah upon the one who is envied, and then begins hating this person. This is because the hatred of the thing being bestowed leads to hatred of the one upon whom it is bestowed, for when the blessings of Allah are bestowed upon an individual, he would love that they go away, and they would not go away except by the one who is envied going away; therefore, he hates him and loves that he not be there.</p>

<p>Jealousy necessarily leads to desire and hatred just as Allah informed us of those that came before us: that they differed,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After their came to them knowledge out of mutual hatred and desire." (Surah Al-Imran (3): 19)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So their differing did not arise due to the lack of knowledge; rather they knew the Truth, but it was due to some of them hating others, just as the envier hates the envied.</p>

<p>In the Sahihs of al-Bukhari and Muslim, Anas bin Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) reports that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do not envy each other, do not hate each other, do not oppose each other, and do not cut relations, rather be servants of Allah as brothers. It is not permissible for a Muslim to disassociate from his brother for more than three days such that they meet and one ignores the other, and the best of them is the one who initiates the salam."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He (ﷺ) said, in the hadith that is agreed to be authentic, reported by Anas also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, none of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Allah, the Most High, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is certainly among you he who would linger behind (from fighting in the Way of Allah). If a misfortune befalls you, he says: ‘Indeed Allah has favored me in that I was not present among them.’ But if a bounty comes to you from Allah, he would surely say - as if there had never been any ties of affection between you and him - ‘Oh! I wish I had been with them; then I would have achieved a great success.’" (Surah An-Nisa’ (4): 72-73)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So these people who lingered behind did not love for their brother Muslims what they loved for themselves; rather, if the Muslims were afflicted with a calamity, they were overjoyed that it only afflicted them, and if they met with blessings they were not happy for them; rather, they wished that they too had a portion of this blessing. So they would not become happy except if they received something of this world or some evil of this world was diverted from them. This was due to them not loving Allah and His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter, for if this had been the case, they would have loved their brothers, and loved what they had received of His blessings, and they would have been hurt by the calamity that had afflicted them.</p>

<p>As for the one who is not made happy by what has made the Muslims happy, and is not grieved by what has made the Muslims grieve then he is not of them. In the Sahihs of al-Bukhari and Muslim from Amir ash-Sha'bi who said: “I heard al-Nu'man bin Bashir delivering a sermon and saying: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying, 'The similitude of the believers with respect to their mutual love, mutual mercy and mutual kindness is like that of one body. When a part of it suffers, the whole body suffers with fever and sleeplessness.'</p>

<p>In the Sahihs of al-Bukhari and Muslim from the hadith of Abu Mas'ud al-Ash'ari (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, 'The Muslim to another Muslim is like a building, one part of it strengthens another,' and he interlaced his fingers."</p>

<h3>Between Jealousy and Miserliness</h3>
<p>Greed is a sickness as is miserliness, and jealousy is worse than miserliness as occurs in the hadith reported by Abu Dawud from the Prophet (ﷺ) that he said, "Jealousy eats away at good deeds just as fire eats away at firewood, and giving charity extinguishes sins just as water extinguishes fire."</p>

<p>This is because the miser only stops himself from having good, but the envier dislikes the favors of Allah bestowed upon His servants. It is possible that a person gives to those lesser than him who would help him achieve his objectives and yet displays jealousy to those of the same level as him just as it is possible for him to be miserly without displaying envy to others. Greed is the basis for this as Allah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And whosoever is saved from his greed, such are they who are successful." (Surah Al-Hashr (59): 9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Sahihs of al-Bukhari and Muslim, the Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Beware of greed for it destroyed those that came before you: it commanded them to be miserly and they were, it commanded them to be oppressive and they were, and it commanded them to break the ties of kinship and they did."</p>

<p>‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Awf used to frequently say in his supplication while making Tawaf, “O Allah! Save my soul from greed.” So a person said to him, “Why is this your most frequent supplication?” He replied, “When I safeguard myself from greed, I safeguard myself from...</p>
