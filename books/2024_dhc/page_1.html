<h1>COMPILER’S INTRODUCTION</h1>

<h2>The Keys to the Life of the Heart</h2>

<p>Ibn ul-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him, said:</p>

<p>The keys to the life of the heart lie in reflecting upon the Qur'an, being humble before Allah in secret, and leaving sins.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Allah, the Most High, said:</p>
    <p>A Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its verses, and that men of understanding may take heed.<br>
    [Surah Sad (38): 29]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Allah informed us that He sent down this Great Qur'an, blessed in its wording, meaning, commands, prohibitions, and regulations. Amongst its blessings is that the one who recites even one word of it then he has a reward, and this reward is increased tenfold, as mentioned in the hadith reported by at-Tirmidhi, and at-Tirmidhi said that it is hasan sahih. Also amongst its blessings is that the one who reads it and acts upon it shall not be misguided in this world, nor fall into distress and misery in the Hereafter as stated by Ibn ‘Abbas (radiyAllahu ‘anhu) in the commentary to the verse,</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>...whoever follows My guidance shall neither go astray nor fall into distress and misery.<br>
    [Surah Ta Ha (20): 123]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amongst its blessings is that the one who learns it and teaches it is from the best of people as occurs in the hadith reported by al-Bukhari,</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The best of you is the one who learns the Qur’an and then teaches it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amongst its blessings is that it will be an intercessor on the Day of Judgement for its companions who used to act by it in this world as occurs in the two ahadith reported by Muslim in his sahih.</p>

<p>He, the Exalted informed us that He revealed the Qur’an so that its meanings, commands, and prohibitions may be reflected over, such that if one were to come across a verse commanding something then he should follow it. If one were to come across a verse forbidding something then he should leave it.</p>

<p>If one were to come across a verse concerning the Mercy of Allah then he would hope for this Mercy and ask for it. If one were to come across a verse threatening with punishment then he would fear this and seek refuge with Allah from it. If one were to come across a verse concerning the glorification of Allah then he would glorify Allah, and through this faith, knowledge, guidance, and ‘aql will increase. Allah said while describing the believers,</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>And when His verses are recited unto them, they increase their faith.<br>
    [Surah Anfal (8): 2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to their containing promises and threats that motivate hope and fear; and Allah, the Most High, said,</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Do they not ponder over the Qur’an or are there locks upon their hearts?<br>
    [Surah Muhammad (47): 24]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amongst the ways of giving life to the heart is to be humble to Allah in secret. Meaning to desire and long for Allah through supplication, seeking forgiveness, turning to Him, asking for victory, Paradise and shelter from Hellfire at the time when Allah descends to the lowest Heaven in the last third of the night, as occurs in the authentic hadith,</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven when a third of the night remains, saying: Who is supplicating to Me that I may answer him? Who is asking of Me that I may give him? Who is seeking forgiveness of Me that I may forgive him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This hadith contains encouragement to stand in the last part of the night, praying, supplicating, and asking for forgiveness, Paradise and safety from the Fire, and supplicating for good in this life and the Hereafter. Indeed Allah has commanded us with supplication and promised to reply, and He who is far removed from imperfection does not break His promises. Amongst the times that this reply will be attained is the last part of the night, and this is a blessing that Allah bestows upon whomsoever He wishes, and Allah is the Possessor of great blessings and bounty.</p>

<p>And from the ways of giving life to the heart is to leave the sins that kill it, as in the hadith,</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When the servant performs a sin a black spot appears on his heart, and if he seeks forgiveness this black spot is removed, and if he returns to sin the black spot grows until his heart becomes black, and this is the 'ran' about which Allah spoke,</p>

    <p>Nay! But on their hearts is the covering of sins (ran) which they used to earn.<br>
    [Surah al-Mutaffifin (83): 14]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The poet said,</p>
    <p>'I saw the sins killing the hearts;<br>
    Breeding ignominy due to their addiction;<br>
    And in the leaving of sins lies its life;<br>
    And it is best for your soul that you preserve it.'</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Ailments of the Hearts and Their Cures</h2>

<p>The hearts are three types:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The correct heart that is secure from all desires that oppose the command of Allah and His prohibitions, and it is secure from all doubts that contradict what He informs. Just as it is secure from worshipping anything else besides Allah and from seeking judgment from any person other than His Messenger.</li>
    <li>The dead heart, this being the opposite of the correct heart containing no life, neither knowing its Lord nor worshipping Him.</li>
    <li>The heart that has some life but also has a defect. So it contains love of Allah, faith in Him, sincerity and trust towards Him from those things that are essential to it remaining alive. It also contains the love of vain desires and preference for them, despicable morals and manners from those things that cause it to die, and it is continuously wavering between these two conditions.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the first type of heart is the living, humble, soft, and gentle heart. The second is the dry, harsh, and dead heart. The third is the heart which is diseased; it can either be made secure or have its destruction sealed.</p>

<p>All of the diseases of the heart are founded upon desires and doubts. The life of the heart and its illumination is the cause of all good to be found in it, and its death and darkness is the cause of all evil to be found in it.</p>

<p>The heart can never be alive and correct except through cognizance of the truth, loving it and preferring it to everything else. There can never be any happiness, joy, or correction for it unless it makes its sole object of worship and desire Allah alone.</p>

<p>This can never be perfected except through the purification of the heart, repentance, and its relinquishing itself from all types of false love and despicable manners. This can never be attained except through striving hard against one’s soul that incites towards evil, and bringing it to account and combating the satans from among the jinn by holding fast to Allah; knowing their plots and objectives, and safeguarding oneself from them through remembrance of Allah, the Exalted, and seeking refuge with Him from them.</p>

<p>The heart becoming defective and weak revolves around two basic matters: the corruption of knowledge and the corruption of intent. These in turn lead to two destructive illnesses - anger and misguidance. Misguidance being the end result of the corruption of intent. So these two diseases are the lords of all the ailments that afflict the heart. Its cure lies in guidance based on knowledge. Guidance based on knowledge is to know the truth and to follow it. The whole of the Qur'an is a cure for these two diseases and others, and it contains perfect guidance.</p>

<h2>Verses of the Qur’an Concerning Healing</h2>

<blockquote>
   <p>Allah, the Most High, said:</p>
   <p>He will heal the breast of a believing folk.<br>
   [Surah Tawbah (9): 14]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>And when I become sick, He heals me.<br>
    [Surah Shu'ara (26): 80]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There has come unto you an exhortation from your Lord, a healing for that which is in your hearts, a guidance and mercy for the believers.<br>
    [Surah Yunus (10): 57]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>And We reveal of the Qur’an that which is a healing and a mercy for the believers...<br>
    [Surah Isra (17): 82]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is a guidance and a healing for those who believe.<br>
    [Surah Fussilat (41): 44]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There comes forth from their bellies a drink of diverse hues wherein is healing for mankind.<br>
    [Surah Nahl (16): 69]</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>CHAPTER ONE</h1>

<h2>Concerning the Ailments of the Hearts and Their Cures</h2>

<p>Indeed all praise is due to Allah, we seek His help, and we seek His forgiveness, and we seek refuge in Allah from the evil of our souls and the evil of our actions. Whomsoever Allah guides, none can misguide, and whomsoever Allah misguides, none can guide. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except for Allah, the One Who has no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Allah the Exalted said about the hypocrites,</p>
    <p>In their hearts is a disease and Allah has increased their disease.<br>
    [Surah al-Baqarah (2): 10]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>That He may make what is thrown in by Satan a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease and whose hearts are hardened.<br>
    [Surah al-Hajj (22): 53]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who spread false news among the people of Madinah cease not, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbors but for a little while.<br>
    [Surah al-Ahzab (33): 60]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>...and that no doubts may be left for the People of the Book and the believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the disbelievers may say, ‘What does Allah intend by this parable?’<br>
    [Surah al-Muddaththir (74): 31]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There has come to you good advice from your Lord, and a healing for that which is in the hearts, a guidance and a mercy for the believers.<br>
    [Surah Yunus (10): 57]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>And We send down from the Qur’an that which is a healing and mercy to those who believe, and it increases the wrong-doers in nothing but loss.<br>
    [Surah al-Isra (17): 82]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>...and heal the breast of a believing people and removes the anger of their hearts...<br>
    [Surah Tawbah (9): 14-15]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The disease of the body is the opposite of its being sound and in good health; it is a degeneration that occurs in it causing a failure of the natural senses of perception and movement. So with respect to its perception either it goes completely such as blindness or deafness, or it perceives objects incorrectly - such as its perceiving something sweet to be bitter or its hallucinating things that have no reality in the real world. With respect to the failure of its movements then examples of this would be the inability to digest food, or the body’s aversion to nourishment that it is in need of, or its desire of things that would weaken it, leading to illnesses as a result of these but not leading to death or physical ruin.</p>

<p>Instead these failures would lead to suffering of the actual body either as a result of consuming a wrong quantity of something or applying something to the body in the wrong way. As for the first, then it could be consuming too little a quantity of nourishment and therefore the body would require more, or it could be by consuming too much and therefore the body would require it to be removed. As for the second, then it could be like extremely high or low temperatures due to incorrect usage of medicine.</p>

<p>The same is true for the disease of the heart...</p>
