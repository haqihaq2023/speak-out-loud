<h3>Summary of Preceeding Text</h3>
<p>
    The text presents insights on the distinguished scholars of Islamic tradition, particularly focusing on Imam Ibn al-Qayyim and his contributions to tafsir, hadith, and Arabic language studies. It recounts the perspectives of various scholars, including al-Hafiz Ibn Nasir ad-Dimishq, who highlights Ibn al-Qayyim's exceptional knowledge, and other scholars who compare his stature to that of Ibn Khuzaymah. They recognize Ibn al-Qayyim's immense influence and knowledge as a great Imam in the fields he specialized in, affirming that he is revered for his insightful writings and understanding of the Qur'an and Sunnah. His passing at the age of sixty is mentioned with a supplication for Allah's mercy upon him, underscoring his legacy.
</p>
<p>
    The text also explores the classification of human hearts, emphasizing the significance of having a "Correct and Sound Heart," described as salim. This heart is characterized by its truthfulness and freedom from desires contrary to Allah’s commands. A sound heart, as defined in the text, is essential for salvation on the Day of Judgment, supported by references from the Qur'an. The descriptions point to a heart that is not only protected against doubts but also dedicated solely to Allah and in alignment with the Prophet Muhammad’s teachings. The notion of servitude is a critical aspect, with the heart's actions, desires, and allegiances directed purely towards Allah.
</p>
<p>
    Delving deeper into the behavioral aspects associated with a sound heart, the text emphasizes that its love, fear, and trust must be directed solely toward Allah. It delineates the heart's need to adhere to the judgments and commands of the Prophet, thereby ensuring that all beliefs and actions are consistent with Islamic teachings. The discussion also touches upon the accountability of believers, highlighting the importance of intent and adherence to the prophetic model in all deeds. It concludes by stressing that each action warrants scrutiny regarding its motivation and compliance with sharia, reinforcing the essential principles of sincerity and obedience within Islamic practice.
</p>

<h1>The Reality of the Heart</h1>

<p>
    This is the reality of servitude (‘ubudiyah) which can only be directed to Allah Alone.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore the truthful and sound heart is that heart which is secure from committing any form of shirk whatsoever and instead, its servitude is directed only to, and purely for, Allah, Exalted is He. Its desire, love, trust and reliance, penitence, humility, fear, and hope are only for Allah, and its actions are purely for His sake. Hence, if it loves, it loves for the sake of Allah; if it hates, it hates for the sake of Allah; if it gives, it gives for the sake of Allah; and if it withholds, it withholds for the sake of Allah.
</p>

<p>
    But this alone does not suffice until the heart becomes secure from submitting to, and going to anybody else but, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for judgement. Therefore the heart ties a firm bond with him (ﷺ), resolving to follow him and obey him alone in sayings and actions. These sayings comprise the saying of the heart: the matters of belief; and the sayings of the tongue which convey what the heart contains. These actions comprise the actions of the heart: its desire, love, dislike, and other connected matters; and the actions of the limbs.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore the judge for all these matters - the major and minor of them - is that which the Messenger (ﷺ) came with. Hence the heart does not put itself before him in any matter related to belief, saying, or action. Allah, Exalted is He, says:
</p>
<blockquote>
    “O you who believe! Do not put yourself forward in front of Allah and His Messenger…” <br>
    <em>Surah Al-Hujurat (49): 1</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
    This means: do not speak of a matter until he has spoken of it and do not act until he has commanded it.
</p>

<p>
    Some of the Salaf said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    “There is no action, even if it be small, except that two records will be unfurled for it: why? how?”
</blockquote>
<p>
    This means: why did you do it? How did you do it?
</p>

<p>
    The first question enquires about the cause, onset, and motive of the action. Was it done for some temporal and worldly gain such as attaining the praise of people? Was it done for fear of people’s censure? Or was the motivation of this action establishing the rights of servitude, seeking the increase of one's love of, and closeness to Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, and seeking the means of drawing close (wasilah) to Him?
</p>

<p>
    The essence of this question is: was it upon you to perform this action for the sake of your Master or for the sake of personal gain and base desire?
</p>

<p>
    The second question enquires about the following of the Messenger (ﷺ) in that action of worship: was the action you did from those actions which have been legislated upon the tongue of My Messenger? Or was it an action that I did not legislate and was not pleased with?
</p>

<p>
    Therefore, the first question concerns sincerity (ikhlas) and the second concerns following (muṭāba‘ah). Allah does not accept any action until both these pre-requisites are met.
</p>

<p>
    The method of absolution from the first question is to purify one's sincerity such that it is for Allah Alone.
</p>

<p>
    The method of absolution from the second question is to actualize the following of the Messenger (ﷺ) and by securing the heart from any intent that would impair its sincerity and any base desire that would impair its following.
</p>

<p>
    This is the reality of the sound and truthful heart from which ensues victory and bliss.
</p>

<h2>The Dead Heart</h2>

<p>
    This is the heart that contains no life. It does not know its Lord and it does not worship Him by complying to His command and doing that which He loves and is pleased with. Instead, it is a slave to its carnal desires, temptations, and pleasures; oblivious of, and indifferent to whether they lead to the displeasure of its Lord and His anger or not. Therefore it worships other than Allah: it directs its love, hope, pleasure, displeasure, glorification, and submission to other than Him. If it loves, it loves for the sake of its base desires; if it hates, it hates for the sake of its base desires; if it gives, it gives for the sake of its base desires; if it withholds, it withholds for the sake of its base desires. It gives preference to its base desires, and these are more beloved to it than the pleasure of its Master.
</p>

<p>
    Base desires are its leader, carnal desires are its commander, ignorance is its driving force, and negligence is the vessel upon which it embarks. It is completely engrossed in pursuing its worldly desires. It is driven wild by the intoxication of its base desires and love of temporal things. It hears the call to Allah and the Abode of the Hereafter from a distant place and does not respond to the sincere advisor. It follows every cunning devil, and the world is the cause of its anger and its pleasure. Base desires have deafened it and blinded it to anything other than falsehood.
</p>

<p>
    Mixing with the person who has this heart is a sickness, interacting with him is poison, and sitting with him is ruin.
</p>

<h2>The Diseased Heart</h2>

<p>
    This is the heart that contains life but also possesses a defect. It has two impulses calling it: one leading it to life and the other leading it to death; and it follows whichever of the two that predominates.
</p>

<p>
    It contains love of Allah, Exalted is He, faith in Him, sincerity to Him, and trust and reliance upon Him: those matters that are essential to its life.
</p>

<p>
    It also contains the love of its carnal desires, giving preference to them, and eagerness to attain them. It contains jealousy, arrogance, self-amazement, and love of ranking through attaining leadership: those matters that necessarily lead to its destruction and ruin.
</p>

<p>
    It is constantly being tried by two callers: one calling it to Allah, His Messenger, and the Abode of the Hereafter; and the other calling it to temporal, worldly matters. It responds to the one that is closest and most influential at the time.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore the first type of heart is the living, humble, soft, attentive, and heedful heart. The second type is the brittle, dry, and dead heart. The third type is the diseased heart, either it is closer to its salvation or it is closer to its devastation.
</p>

<p>
    Allah, the Glorious, has mentioned these types of the hearts in His saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
    “Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you without Shaytan insinuating something into his recitation while he was reciting. But Allah revokes whatever Shaytan insinuates and Allah confirms His Signs; Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. That He may make what Shaytan insinuates a trial for those in whose heart is a disease and whose hearts are hardened. Indeed, the wrongdoers are entrenched in hostility. And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it [the Qur'an] is the truth from your Lord, that they may believe therein and their hearts may submit to it with humility. Indeed, Allah is the Guide of those who believe, to the Straight Path.” <br>
    <em>Surah Al-Hajj (22): 52-54</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
    In these three verses, Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, has mentioned two types of hearts put to trial and one type that is victorious. The two types of heart that are put to trial are the diseased and the harsh heart. The victorious heart is the heart of the believer that is humble before its Lord; it is at rest and satisfied with Him, submissive and obedient to Him.
</p>

<p>
    It is desired of the heart and other limbs that they be healthy and sound, having no defect so that they can do that which agrees to their nature and fulfill the purpose for which they were created. The heart’s stepping outside the bounds of steadfastness in obedience (istiqamah) could either be due to its dryness and harshness, or the absence of doing that which is desired of it. In this respect, it is like a mute tongue or an eye that cannot see, or only partially see, due to some form of illness or defect.
</p>

<p>
    This is why the hearts have been classified into three types:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The healthy and sound heart which contains no impediment preventing it from accepting the truth, loving it, and giving it preference other than its coming to know of it. Therefore, its comprehension of the truth is correct and it accepts it with complete submission.</li>
    <li>The dead, harsh and dry heart that does not accept the truth nor submit to it.</li>
    <li>The diseased heart; when its disease predominates, it joins the ranks of the dead and harsh heart; but if its soundness predominates, it joins the ranks of the truthful and sound heart.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Anything that is directed to the person by Shaytan such as his making him hear certain words, or suggesting to the heart such as suspicion and doubt acts as a trial for the latter two types of hearts and serves to further strengthen the living, truthful, and sound heart.
</p>

<p>
    This is because the living heart rejects all of this, dislikes it, and is angered by it for it knows that the truth opposes it. Therefore, it submits to the truth and is content with it. It knows the fallacy of that which Shaytan has tempted it with, and therefore increases with respect to its certainty of the truth, its love of it, and its rejection of falsehood.
</p>

<p>
    However, the heart put to trial remains in doubt and dispute concerning what was directed to it by Shaytan. The healthy and sound heart, on the other hand, is not harmed by what Shaytan directs to it.
</p>

<p>
    Hudhayfah bin al-Yaman said that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “Trials and tribulations will be presented to the heart [one after another] in the same way that the mat is knitted together, reed by reed. Any heart that accepts them will have a black spot form on it. Any heart that rejects them will have a white spot put on it until the hearts end up being one of two types: a black heart, murky and like an overturned vessel, it does not know the good and does not reject the evil; all it knows is its base desires; and a white heart which will not be harmed by trials for as long as the heavens and the earth remain.”
</p>

<p>
    Hence, he likened the onset of trials upon the heart to knotting the reeds of a mat, one after the other.
</p>

<p>
    He divided the hearts into two types based on how they react to these trials:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>A heart that infuses trials when exposed to them in the same way that a sponge soaks in water. Therefore it has a black spot form on it, and it will keep on accepting these trials until it becomes totally black and inverted. This is the meaning of his saying, ‘like an overturned vessel’, i.e., inverted. Then when it becomes black and inverted, it is subjugated to the following two dangerous diseases that push it to destruction:
        <ol>
            <li>Its confusion of good and evil such that it does not know the good or reject the evil. It is also possible that its disease dupes a person into believing good to be evil, evil to be good, Sunnah to be bid‘ah, bid‘ah to be Sunnah, truth to be falsehood, and falsehood to be truth.</li>
            <li>Its giving precedence to its base desires when seeking judgment rather than that which the Messenger (ﷺ) came with, its yielding to them, and following them.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>A white heart that has been set ablaze with the light of faith, and its niche has been illuminated. When a trial is presented to it, it rejects it and repels it, and hence its light, blaze, and strength increase.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The trials that are presented to the hearts are the causes of its disease. They are the trials of carnal desires and doubts, the trials of aimless wandering and misguidance, the trials of sins and innovations, and the trials of oppression and ignorance. The first type leads to the corruption of desire and intent, and the second type leads to the corruption of knowledge and belief.
</p>

<p>
    The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) divided the hearts into four categories, as is authentically reported from Hudhayfah bin al-Yaman: “The hearts are of four types: The heart that has exclusively been illuminated by a blazing torch, and that is the heart of the believer; the heart that is encased and that is the heart of the disbeliever; the heart that is inverted and that is the heart of the hypocrite - he knew only to reject, and he saw only to become blind; and the heart that has two impulses: an impulse calling it to faith and an impulse calling it to hypocrisy: it belongs to the impulse that is most prominent.”
</p>

<p>
    The meaning of his saying ‘a heart that has exclusively...’ means a heart that has detached itself from everything besides Allah and His Messenger. Therefore, it has separated and secured itself from everything save the truth.
</p>

<p>
    The meaning of his saying ‘illuminated by a blazing torch’ refers to the niche of faith. Therefore, he indicated by his words, ‘that has exclusively...’ that it is secure from false doubts and misguiding carnal desires. He indicated by his words, ‘a blazing torch’ that it was set ablaze and illuminated by the light of knowledge and faith.
</p>

<p>
    The ‘encased heart’ refers to the heart of the disbeliever because it is wrapped by a veil and covering, and hence the light of knowledge and faith cannot reach it. This is as Allah said, relating from the Jews that,
</p>
<blockquote>
    “They say: our hearts are wrapped…” <br>
    <em>Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 88</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
    This veil is the covering that Allah has placed on their hearts by way of punishment for their rejecting the truth and being too arrogant to accept it. Therefore, it is a covering upon the hearts, a seal for the ears, and blindness for the eyes. This is the obscuring screen upon the eyes talked about in His saying,
</p>
<blockquote>
    “And when you recite the Qur'an, We put between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter, an obscuring screen. We have put coverings over their hearts lest they should understand it and deafness in their ears.” <br>
    <em>Surah Al-Isra (17): 45-46</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
    When the people who have these types of hearts are admonished to purify their ‘ibadah and following (i‘tidah), they turn on their heels and run!
</p>

<p>
    The ‘inverted heart’ refers to the heart of the hypocrite as Allah, the Exalted says,
</p>
<blockquote>
    “Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties regarding the hypocrites? Allah has cast them back [to disbelief] because of what they have earned.” <br>
    <em>Surah An-Nisa’ (4): 88</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
    This means: He caused them to relapse and return to the falsehood that they used to be in due to their working false deeds.
</p>

<p>
    This is the most evil of hearts and the vilest of them, for it believes falsehood to be the truth and shows love and allegiance to those who follow it. It also believes the truth to be falsehood and displays enmity to those who follow it. The Aid of Allah is sought!
</p>

<p>
    The ‘heart that has two urges’ refers to the heart that is not entrenched in faith because it has not devoted itself solely to the truth that Allah sent His Messenger with. Instead, it contains some faith and some of its opposite: it is closer to disbelief than faith sometimes; and at other times it is closer to faith than disbelief. The heart follows whatever is most influential at that time.
