<h4>Summary of Preceeding Text</h4>
<p>In these verses, Allah draws parallels between two contrasting figures to highlight the superiority of His own attributes over the deficiencies of idols and other false deities. The first parable describes a slave who lacks power and is dependent on his master, comparing him to a person endowed with blessings from Allah who uses those provisions for the benefit of others. The passage stresses that the capabilities of the latter, who is able to act righteously, place him in a position far above the powerless idol, which cannot provide any benefit. This stark contrast emphasizes Allah's unique power and justice, distinguishing Him from the impotency of idols.</p>

<p>The second parable focuses on two men, one who is mute and incapable of doing anything productive, and the other who is knowledgeable, acts justly, and guides others. This analogy serves to illustrate the distinction between Allah, who possesses ultimate knowledge and justice, and the powerless idol that serves as a burden. The text underscores that Allah, blessed with all attributes of perfection, cannot be equated to a being lacking the capacity or logic to benefit others. Through these examples, the message asserts that only Allah is deserving of worship, as He is the source of all goodness, wisdom, and justice.</p>

<p>The narrative then moves to highlight the competition in good deeds among the early Muslims, specifically focusing on figures like ‘Umar bin al-Khattab and Abu Bakr. It shares an anecdote where ‘Umar strives to outdo Abu Bakr in charitable giving, indicating a healthy competition in virtues amongst believers. Additionally, the account of Prophet Musa reflects a similar sentiment of admiration towards the Prophet Muhammad, showcasing a sense of pride in the latter’s accomplishments and the blessings bestowed upon him by Allah. This context reinforces the theme of striving for righteousness amongst the faithful individuals while acknowledging the higher status of another who serves the purpose of God’s message.</p>

<h2>Main Text</h2>
<h3>Abdullah Used to Teach the People</h3>
<p>Abdullah used to teach the people and his brother used to feed them, and so they used to exalt them due to this.</p>
<p>Mu‘awiyah (radiyAllahu ‘anhu) saw the people asking Ibn ‘Umar about the rites of Hajj, and Ibn ‘Umar would give them the verdicts, to which Mu‘awiyah said, ‘By Allah this is nobility’ or something similar.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Competition between as-Siddiq and ‘Umar</h3>
<p>So here is ‘Umar bin al-Khattab (radiyAllahu ‘anh) competing with Abu Bakr (radiyAllahu ‘anh) with respect to spending in charity, as is established in the Sahih (of al-Bukhari) from ‘Umar bin al-Khattab (radiyAllahu ‘anhu) that he said:</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to give in charity, and this coincided with my possessing some wealth. So I said to myself: ‘If there is a day that I can better Abu Bakr than it is this one.’ So I went with half of my wealth, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked me, ‘What have you left for your family?’ I replied, ‘The same amount.’ Then Abu Bakr came with everything that he possessed, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked him, ‘What have you left for your family?’ He replied, ‘I have left Allah and His Messenger for them.’ So I said, ‘I will never be able to better you in anything!’</p>
<p>So what ‘Umar did here was competition and the permitted type of jealousy (ghubta), but the state of as-Siddiq was better than his, and thus he would generally be the victor in such competition due to his indifference to the condition of others.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Moses Displays Ghubta</h3>
<p>Likewise is the case with Prophet Musa, as is mentioned in the hadith of Mi'raj that he competed and felt jealousy towards the Prophet (ﷺ) to the point that he cried due to the extent to which the Prophet (ﷺ) had surpassed him. So it was said to him, ‘Why are you crying?’ He replied, ‘I am crying because there is a servant who shall be sent after me, and more of his nation shall enter Paradise than mine.’</p>
<p>This hadith is also reported in other than the Sahih with a different wording:</p>
<p>We passed a person while he was saying in a loud voice, ‘You have blessed him and honoured him (over me).’ So we were raised to him and gave him our salam. He replied to our salam and said, ‘Who is this with you, O Jibra’il?’ He said, ‘This is Ahmad.’ He said, ‘Welcome, O Illiterate Prophet who has conveyed the Message of his Lord and sincerely advised his nation.’ Then we moved on, and I said, ‘Who was this, O Jibra’il?’ He replied, ‘That was Musa bin ‘Imran.’ I said, ‘And who was he censuring?’ He replied, ‘He was censuring your Lord with regards to you.’ I said, ‘He was raising his voice to His Lord?’ He replied, ‘Indeed Allah knew his truthfulness.’</p>
<p>So in this, ‘Umar resembled Musa, and the condition of our Prophet (ﷺ) was superior to that of Musa for he did not possess any of this permissible jealousy.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Whoever's Ranking Becomes Lofty, He is Secured from Ghubta</h3>
<p>Similar to this from amongst the Sahabah were Abu ‘Ubaydah bin Jarrah and those like him who were free from these types of concerns, and due to this, they were of a more exalted rank than those who would compete and display jealousy (ghubta) even though it was permitted. This is why Abu ‘Ubaydah deserved to be called the trusted one of this Ummah.</p>
<p>For if the one trusted does not have any rivalry and desire in his self for the things that he is entrusted with, then he is the most deserving of having the trust placed in him. The one who is known to possess no rivalry in greater matters is entrusted with the smaller matters, and the one known to have no reason to steal from the wealth is entrusted with the wealth. As for the one who finds in himself treachery that resembles that of a wolf entrusted with sheep, then he is not able to discharge the trust placed in him due to his having in his heart a desire for what he is entrusted with.</p>
<p>It is reported in the Musnad of Ahmad from Anas (radiyAllahu ‘anhu) that he said:</p>
<p>We were sitting in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) one day, and he said, ‘A person is about to arrive from this mountain path who is from the people of Paradise.’ So a person from the Ansar arrived, his beard dripping with the water of wudu and holding his sandals in his left hand, and he gave us the salam. The next day the Prophet (ﷺ) said words of similar import, and the same person appeared in the same condition. On the third day, the Prophet (ﷺ) again said words of similar import, and again this person appeared in the same condition.</p>
<p>So when the Prophet (ﷺ) left, ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr al-‘As followed this person and said, ‘Indeed I have abused my father, and I swore that I would not go to him for three days. So if you would let me stay with you until those three days expire, I would do so.’ He replied, ‘Yes.’</p>
<p>Anas continued saying:</p>
<p>So ‘Abdullah told us that he spent three nights with this person yet he did not see him stand for the night prayer at all. All he did was, when he turned sides on his bed, he would mention Allah and make takbir and would do this until he stood for the Fajr prayer. ‘Abdullah said, ‘Except that I never heard him speak except good.’ So when the three days were over, I was eager to make note of his actions. I said, ‘O servant of Allah, there was no hatred or disassociation between my father and me, but I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying on three occasions, ‘A person is about to arrive who is from the people of Paradise,’ and you arrived on those three occasions. So I wished to stay with you so that I may look at your actions and emulate them. But I have not seen you perform a great deal of actions, so what is it that has reached you to make the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say what he said?’ He replied, ‘It is nothing more than what you have seen, except that I do not find in myself any disloyalty to any of the Muslims, and neither do I find any jealousy for the wealth that Allah has bestowed upon them.’</p>
<p>‘Abdullah said, “This is that which has reached you and is something that we cannot endure.”</p>
<p>So in the saying of ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr to him, ‘This is something that has reached you and something that we cannot endure,’ lies an indication of his lack of jealousy and his being secure from all types of jealousy. This is why Allah praised the Ansar with His saying:</p>
<p class="quote">"And have no jealousy in their breasts for that which has been given to the Muhajirin, and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that."</p>
<p>Surah al-Hashr (59):9</p>
<p>Meaning that which has been given to their brothers from the Muhajirin. The scholars of tafsir have stated:</p>
<p class="quote">'They do not find in their breasts jealousy and hatred for what has been given to the Muhajirin.'</p>

<hr>

<h3>Blameworthy Jealousy</h3>
<p>As for the jealousy that is totally blameworthy, then Allah has said with regards to the Jews:</p>
<p class="quote">"Many of the People of the Book wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their own selves even after the truth has become clear to them."</p>
<p>Surah al-Baqarah (2):109</p>
<p>‘They wish’ meaning that they hope to make you apostasise from your religion out of jealousy. So jealousy was the deciding factor behind their wish even after the Truth has been made clear to them. This is because when they saw you attain what you attained of blessings - in fact they saw you attain that which they themselves had never attained - they became jealous of you. Similarly, this is mentioned in another verse:</p>
<p class="quote">"Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty? Then We have already given the family of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom..."</p>
<p>Surah an-Nisa’ (4):54-55</p>
<p>Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak. From the evil of what He has created. And from the evil of the darkening (night) as it comes with its darkness. And from the evil of the witchcrafts when they blow in the knots. And from the evil of the envier when he envies.</p>
<p class="quote">Surah Al-Falaq (113):1-5</p>
<p>A group of scholars of tafsir mentioned that this Surah was revealed due to the jealousy of the Jews harboured towards the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) to the extent that they performed magic on him. The magic was done by the Jew, Labid bin al-‘Asam.</p>
<p>So the one who is jealous, hating the favours bestowed by Allah upon someone else is an oppressor, going beyond bounds due to this. As for the one who dislikes that someone else be blessed and wishes to be blessed in the same way, then this is forbidden for him except in that which will bring him closer to Allah. So if he were to wish for something that has been given to someone else which would help bring him closer to Allah, then there is no problem in this. However, his wishing for it in his heart, without looking to the condition of someone else, is better and more excellent.</p>
<p>Then if this person were to act, dictated by this jealousy, he would be an oppressor going beyond bounds, deserving of punishment unless he repents. So the one who is affected by the jealousy of another is oppressed and should be enjoined to patience and taqwa. He should be patient of the harm inflicted upon him by the one who is jealous, and he should forgive and overlook, just as Allah said:</p>
<p class="quote">"...but forgive and overlook until Allah brings about His Command."</p>
<p>Surah al-Baqarah (2):109</p>
<p>Indeed Yusuf (alayhis salam) was tried by the jealousy of his brothers:</p>
<p class="quote">"When they said: Truly, Yusuf and his brother are loved more by our father than we..."</p>
<p>Surah Yusuf (12):8</p>
<p>So they were envied due to their father favouring them over the rest of the brothers, which is why Ya‘qub said to Yusuf,</p>
<p class="quote">"O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they arrange a plot against you. Indeed! Satan is an open enemy to man!"</p>
<p>Surah Yusuf (12):5</p>
<p>They went on to oppress him by discussing his murder and throwing him in the well, his being sold as a slave by the ones who took him to the land of the disbelievers, and his subsequently being owned by these disbelieving people. Then after being oppressed, Yusuf was tried by the one who invited him to an indecent deed and attempted to seduce him, and she sought aid from anyone who would help her in this, but he was preserved from this. Instead, he chose to be imprisoned rather than perform this indecent deed, preferring the punishment of this world rather than the Displeasure of Allah (in the Hereafter).</p>
<p>Hence he was oppressed by the one who desired him due to her base desires and her corrupt objective. So this love with which she desired him arose as a result of her succumbing to the vain desires of her heart, and its happiness or sadness lay in his accepting or rejecting the temptation. He was also oppressed by those who hated him with a hatred that led to his being thrown in the well, then his becoming captive and owned without his choice; therefore, these people removed him from the absolute freedom that he enjoyed to becoming forced into slavery to the false worshippers. This forced him to seek refuge in the prison out of his own free will, thereby making his trial greater.</p>
<p>His patience on this occasion arose out of his own volition coupled with his fear of Allah, thus differing from his patience at their oppression, which was having patience at the onset of calamities, and if one were not to be patient at the likes of these, then he would take to the way of mere animals.</p>
<p>This second type of patience, arising from one’s free will, is the more excellent of the two. This is why Allah said:</p>
<p class="quote">"Indeed he who fears Allah, and is patient, then surely Allah makes not the reward of the doers of good to be lost."</p>
<p>Surah Yusuf (12):90</p>
<p>Likewise, when the believer is harmed due to his faith; and disbelief, transgression, and disobedience are sought from him - and if he were not to accept this, then he would be harmed and punished - then he should choose this harm and punishment over reneging from his religion - even if it results in imprisonment or banishment from his land - just as was done by the Muhajirin in their choosing to leave their settlements rather than leave their religion for which they were harmed and punished.</p>
<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) was harmed in a number of different ways, but he was patient throughout this with a patience that arose out of his own volition, and indeed he was harmed in this way only that he may do what he did out of his own choice. So this patience of his was greater than the patience of Yusuf, for only an indecent action was sought from Yusuf, and he was only punished by imprisonment when he did not comply. But disbelief was sought from the Prophet (ﷺ) and his Companions, and when they did not do this - then they were punished by being slaughtered and other such harms - the least of which was imprisonment, for the polytheists imprisoned him and Bani Hashim for a time in a mountain pass. Then when Abu Talib died, they became more severe against him, and when the Ansar gave him the pledge of allegiance, and when the polytheists came to know of this, they tried to prevent him from leaving (for Madinah) and tried to detain him and his Companions. Then all of them emigrated secretly except for ‘Umar bin al-Khattab and those like him.</p>
<p>So what befell the believers came about as a result of their choosing obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and it was not from the afflictions that occur without the servant’s choice of the type that Yusuf was tried with, and neither of the type of his being separated from his father. So this patience endured by the believers was the nobler of the two types of patience, and its possession was esteemed greatly.</p>
