<h4>Summary of Preceding Text</h4>
<p>
    In the teachings found within the Qur'an, Allah presents vivid parables that illustrate the stark contrast between truth
    and falsehood, as well as the condition of the hearts. For instance, in Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:17), Allah describes the 
    ephemeral nature of truth and the deceptive façade of hypocrisy by comparing it to foam that rises on the surface. 
    This metaphor serves to communicate how superficial appearances can mask underlying realities. Furthermore, Surah 
    Al-Baqarah (2:17-20) emphasizes the dire consequences of disbelief, likening the state of disbelievers to individuals 
    who, despite having been illuminated by knowledge and guidance, find themselves enveloped in darkness, deaf to truth, 
    and blind to clarity.
</p>
<p>
    The Qur'an also vividly portrays the condition of the heart, specifically distinguishing between the "alive" heart, 
    which is aware and illuminated, and the "dead" heart, which is oblivious and unresponsive. The teachings imply that while 
    one may possess physical capabilities, such as sight and hearing, a heart devoid of understanding is likened to that of 
    an animal—alive in body but lacking spiritual awareness. For instance, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:171), disbelievers are 
    illustrated as sheep that can hear but do not comprehend. This comparison extends to various verses emphasizing that a 
    truly understanding heart can connect with divine guidance, while a hardened heart remains unyielding.
</p>
<p> 
    Furthermore, Allah illustrates the futility of the disbeliever’s state through parables of those who neglect divine 
    signs and truths despite having been granted a form of life. Surah Al-An'nam (6:25) and other verses challenge the 
    presumption of those who ignore the call to faith. Here, the state of individuals who acknowledge good under duress 
    only to forget when relieved from hardship underscores the hollow nature of their acknowledgment. Thus, these teachings 
    compel a reflection on genuine faith and the necessity of a heart that not only hears but also comprehends the divine 
    message, urging believers to nurture their hearts to seek understanding and wisdom in their spiritual journey.
</p>

<h1>Understanding Disbelief and Hypocrisy</h1>
<p>
    So He informed us that their hearts cannot understand, and their ears cannot hear, and they do not believe in what 
    they have seen of the Fire as He informed us about them when He said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "And they say: ‘Our hearts are under coverings from that which you invite us to, and in our ears is deafness, and 
    between us and you is a screen."  
    <br>Surah Fussilat (41): 5
</blockquote>
<p>
    So they mentioned the barriers upon their hearts, ears, and eyes. Their bodies are alive—hearing and seeing—but this 
    is a life of the body devoid of life in the heart—like the life of an animal—for the animals possess hearing and 
    seeing, and eat and drink and marry.
</p>
<p>This is why Allah said:</p>
<blockquote>
    "The example of those who disbelieve is as that of him who shouts to (the flock of sheep) that hears nothing but 
    calls and cries."  
    <br>Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 171
</blockquote>
<p>
    Likening them to the cattle, at whom the shepherd shouts, and they hear nothing except the cry (not understanding 
    what is said), as He said in other verses:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are only like cattle—nay, they are even farther astray 
    from the Path."  
    <br>Surah Al-Furqan (25): 44
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "And indeed We have created many of the jinn and Mankind for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, 
    they have eyes wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle—nay, even more astray..."  
    <br>Surah Al-A'raf (7): 179
</blockquote>
<p>
    A group of the commentators, when referring to these verses and those that resembled them such as the verse:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying down on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We have removed 
    his harm from him, he passes on his way as if he has never invoked Us for a harm that touched him!"  
    <br>Surah Yunus (10): 12
</blockquote>
<p>
    Regarding these and other such verses that mention the faults of man and their condemnation, the commentators said:
</p>
<p>
    These verses refer to the disbelievers, and that the meaning of ‘man’ here is ‘the disbelievers.’
</p>
<p>
    So the one who hears this explanation is left thinking that one who openly manifests Islam is not included in this 
    condemnation and threat, rather his thoughts link these verses to those who openly manifested shirk from amongst the 
    Arabs, or to those he knows to have openly shown disbelief such as the Jews, the Christians, and the polytheists of 
    Turkey and India—and hence he would not benefit from these verses that Allah revealed so that His servants may be 
    guided.
</p>
<p>
    So, it is said in reply that firstly: those that openly manifest Islam include amongst them the believer and hypocrite, 
    and the hypocrites are many in all periods of time, and they are in the lowest level of the Hellfire.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly: man possesses a strain of hypocrisy and disbelief even if he possesses faith along with this, as the Prophet 
    (ﷺ) said in the hadith reported by both al-Bukhari and Muslim:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "There are four qualities which if found in a person make him a pure hypocrite, and the one who has a portion of them 
    has a portion of hypocrisy until he leaves them: when he speaks he lies, when he is entrusted, he betrays, when he 
    makes a covenant, he proves treacherous, when he quarrels, he behaves in an evil and insulting manner."
</blockquote>
<p>
    So he informed us that the one who has a portion of these then he has a portion of hypocrisy, and it is established 
    in the Sahih of al-Bukhari that he said to Abu Dhar:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Indeed you have displayed a trait of Jahiliyyah in you."
</blockquote>
<p>
    And Abu Dhar was from the most truthful of people with respect to his faith. He (ﷺ) said in the authentic hadith:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Four (traits) in my Ummah are from the matters of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic ignorance): boasting about noble descent, 
    abusing the lineage, wailing [over the dead], and seeking rain from the stars."
</blockquote>
<p>
    "You will indeed follow the ways of those that came before you, inch by inch such that if they were to enter a lizard 
    hole, you too would do so." They asked, "Do you mean the Jews and Christians?" He replied, "Who else?"
</p>
<p>
    What the early nations took to shall also be taken to by my nation, cubit by cubit and handspan by handspan. They said, 
    "Do you mean the Persians and the Romans?" To which he replied, “Who else from amongst the people could it be?”
</p>
<p>
    Ibn Abi Mulaykah said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "I met thirty of the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ), all of them fearing hypocrisy for themselves."
</blockquote>
<p>
    And from ‘Ali - or Hudhayfah - that he said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "The heart has four types: the clear heart that is illuminated by a torch - this is the heart of the believer. The 
    encased heart - this is the heart of the disbeliever, the inverted heart - this is the heart of the hypocrite, and 
    the heart that has two attractions, a time when it is called to faith, and a time when it is called to hypocrisy - 
    these are a people that have mixed good actions with evil ones."
</blockquote>
<p>
    So when this is understood, it becomes known that every servant benefits from what Allah mentioned concerning faith, 
    either extolling the branches of faith or censuring the branches of disbelief.
</p>

<h1>The Need for Beneficial Knowledge</h1>
<p>
    This is because the person, even if he has believed that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and that the Qur’an is 
    the truth in a general way, is commonly in need of knowledge of that which would benefit him and harm him. He is in 
    need of knowledge concerning what he has been commanded to do and forbidden from doing in the finer aspects of the 
    matters and in those areas of which he has no knowledge. Not only this but we find that that which he does have 
    knowledge of, he does not put the greater part of it to practice! Assuming that all of the commands and prohibitions 
    contained in the Qur’an and Sunnah have reached him, then the Qur’an and Sunnah contain laws that are general and 
    universal for which it is not possible to specify to every individual person—therefore the person has been commanded 
    due to the likes of this to ask for guidance to the Straight Path.
</p>
<p>
    Guidance to the Straight Path includes all of the following matters: cognizance of what the Messenger (ﷺ) came with in 
    detail, cognizance of what comes under his general orders and concern for acting according to one's knowledge, for 
    indeed just having knowledge is not a cause for attaining guidance if one does not act according to his knowledge. 
    This is why He said to His Prophet after the treaty of Hudaybiyyah:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Indeed We have given you a manifest victory. That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and future, complete 
    His favour upon you, and guide you on a Straight Path."  
    <br>Surah Al-Fath (48): 1-2
</blockquote>
<p>
    And He said with respect to Musa and Harun:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "And We gave them the clear Scripture, and guided them to the Right Path."  
    <br>Surah As-Saffat (37): 117-118
</blockquote>
<p>
    The Muslims have differed as to what Allah willed from the textual matters - matters of knowledge, belief, and action 
    while all of them are agreed that Muhammad is the truth and the Qur’an is the truth. If all of them were to have 
    attained guidance to the Straight Path in totality then they would never have differed. Furthermore, the majority 
    of those who know what Allah has ordered disobey Him and do not follow His way. If they were guided to the Straight 
    Path in these matters then they certainly would have performed what they had been commanded to do and left what 
    they had been forbidden from. As for those whom Allah guided from amongst this nation until they became from the 
    God-Fearing Friends of Allah, then the greatest reason for this was their supplicating to Allah with this supplication:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Guide us to the Straight Path."  
    <br>Surah Al-Fatihah (1): 6
</blockquote>
<p>
    in every prayer along with the knowledge of their continuous need of Allah that He guide them on the Straight Path. 
    So due to their continually saying this supplication and their acknowledging their continuous need of Him they became 
    God-Fearing Friends of Allah.
</p>
<p>
    Sahl bin ‘Abdullah at-Tustori said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "There is not a route between a servant and Allah closer to Him than need."
</blockquote>
<p>
    The one who has attained guidance in the past is in need of guidance in the future; this is the real meaning behind 
    the saying of those who say that it means: ‘establish us and guide us to being firm upon the Straight Path.’ The 
    opinion of those who say that it means: ‘increase us in guidance’ includes what has preceded. But all that has been 
    stated refers to His guidance to the Straight Path that is to be granted in the future, for indeed action in the 
    future is upon knowledge that is not yet attained. And the person is not considered to be one who is guided until he 
    acts according to his knowledge in the future, but it is possible that this knowledge not be there in the future; 
    rather it could be removed from the heart, and if it still be there it is also possible that it not be acted upon. 
    Therefore all of mankind is in dire need of this supplication; this is why Allah made it obligatory upon them in 
    every prayer and they are not in need of any other supplication as they are of this one. When guidance is obtained 
    to the Straight Path then help, provision, and all of the happiness that the soul seeks are obtained [from Allah]. 
    Allah knows best.
</p>

<h1>The Reality of the Life of the Heart</h1>
<p>
    Know that the life of the heart and other than it is not merely one of sensation, movement, and intent, or merely one of 
    knowledge and ability as assumed by a group of investigators into the Knowledge of Allah and His power such as Abū al-Husain 
    al-Basri. They said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "He can only be considered to have life as long as he knows and is able."
</blockquote>
<p>
    This is not the case; rather life is an attribute existing independently in the described, and it is a condition for the 
    existence of knowledge, intent, and the ability to perform actions out of choice. Life is also a necessary outcome of these—so 
    every living thing has understanding, intention, and everything that has knowledge, intent, and performs actions out of choice 
    is alive.
</p>
<p>
    The noun ‘modesty’ is derived from ‘life’, so the heart that is alive—its owner is also alive—and it contains modesty 
    which prevents it from performing evil and despicable actions, because in the modesty of the heart lies its immunity 
    from these types of actions. This is why the Prophet (ﷺ) said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Modesty is from faith."
</blockquote>
<p>
    And he said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Modesty and bashfulness are two branches from amongst the branches of faith, and obscenity and boasting are two 
    branches from the branches of hypocrisy."
</blockquote>
<p>
    This is why the living being is clearly affected by despicable actions and he has an intent that prevents him from 
    performing them in contravention to the one who is shameless because he is not alive and therefore has no modesty and 
    therefore no faith that would restrain him from evil. So if the heart is alive and the person dies in its separation 
    from the body, then the death of the soul lies in its separation from the body not in the fact that it, in and of 
    itself, has died—with the meaning of life leaving it. This is why Allah the Exalted said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Do not say those who are slain in the Way of Allah: ‘they are dead’, rather they are alive..."  
    <br>Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 154
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Think not of those who are slain in the Way of Allah as dead. Nay, they are alive..."  
    <br>Surah Al ‘Imran (3): 169
</blockquote>
<p>
    Despite the fact that they have died are included in His sayings:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Every soul shall taste of death..."  
    <br>Surah Al ‘Imran (3): 185
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Indeed you will die and they will die..."  
    <br>Surah Az-Zumar (39): 30
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "He is the One Who gave you life, then will cause you to die, then give you life."  
    <br>Surah Al-Hajj (22): 66
</blockquote>
<p>
    Therefore, the death that is affirmed is not the same as the negated death.
</p>
<p>
    "The affirmed death is the separation of the soul from the body, and the negated death is the leaving of life in 
    totality from the body and soul. This is similar to the fact that sleep is the brother of death." Allah said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "It is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keeps 
    those (souls) for which He ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed."  
    <br>Surah Az-Zumar (39): 42  
</blockquote>
<p>
    The Prophet (ﷺ) used to say when he awoke from sleep,
</p>
<blockquote>
    "All praise is due to Allah Who gives us life after He had caused us to die and unto Him is the resurrection."
</blockquote>
