    <h4>Summary of Preceding Text</h4>
    <p>The content focuses on the concept of guidance and the living essence of the heart from an Islamic perspective. It emphasizes the importance of a specific supplication for guidance to the Straight Path that is recited in every prayer, signifying that mankind is in dire need of this divine assistance. The text points out that true guidance involves not just knowledge, but also the action that stems from that knowledge, as one is not considered truly guided until they act in accordance with what they have learned. The author argues that while individuals may possess knowledge, they remain reliant on Allah for the ability to act upon it, which makes the supplication for guidance crucial.</p>
    
    <p>The discussion then transitions to the nature of the heart and its significance. The heart is described as being alive when it possesses understanding and intention, serving as a protective mechanism against evil through modesty. The author cites prophetic teachings about modesty being linked to faith, suggesting that a heart that is alive is characterized by a sense of modesty that restrains individuals from committing wrongful acts. This contrasts with those who lack such a disposition, described as shameless and devoid of living faith. The narrative clarifies that true death is the separation of the soul from the body, while the heart can retain life beyond physical death, highlighted by the mention of martyrs who are deemed alive despite having died.</p>

    <p>Lastly, the text addresses the concept of envy, describing it as a condition of the heart that arises from awareness of others' blessings. Envy is connected to one's emotional and spiritual state, suggesting that those who find themselves in such a grievance may struggle to appreciate the benefits outlined in their faith. The narrative illustrates the complexity of human emotions as they relate to spiritual conditions and intentions, ultimately underpinning the ongoing theme that the state of one's heart profoundly affects the capacity to act righteously in both the spiritual and worldly realms.</p>

    <h1>Envy is a Sickness of the Heart</h1>

    <p>Some people said while explaining its meaning:</p>
    
    <p>Envy (hasad) is a grievance that befalls one due to knowledge of the good condition of the wealthy.</p>

    <p>So in accordance with this, it is not possible that the person upon whom the blessings have been bestowed be jealous of these blessings because this person has them and is accustomed to them.</p>

    <p>A group of people said: It is a desire to have the blessings removed from the one who is envied, even if the one who is jealous does not attain the likes of these blessings.</p>

    <p>This is different from ghubta (also meaning envy) because it refers to a desire to possess the blessings bestowed upon the one who is envied but without the desire to see them removed from him.</p>

    <h2>The Types of Hasad</h2>

    <p>Strictly speaking, envy (hasad) is hatred and disliking the good condition of the envied one. This has two types:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Unrestricted dislike of the blessings bestowed upon the envied. This is the type of jealousy which incurs blame, so when one hates something he is then hurt and grieved by the existence of what he hates, and this becomes a sickness in his heart such that he takes pleasure in the removal of the blessings from the envied, even if this does not result in any benefit to him except for the single benefit of having the pain that was in his soul removed. But this pain is not removed except as a result of his continuously watching the envied, so that the jealous person finds relief when the blessing is removed, but then it becomes more severe, as is the case of the one who is sick; for it is possible that this blessing, or one similar to it, returns to the envied. This is why this second group said: It is a desire to have the blessings removed, for indeed the one who dislikes the blessings bestowed upon others desires to see them removed.</li>
        
        <li>That he dislikes the superiority of that person over him, and he desires to be like him or better. This is jealousy and has been called ghubta, and the Prophet (ﷺ) called it hasad in the hadith reported by both al-Bukhari and Muslim from the hadith of Ibn Mas‘ud and Ibn ‘Umar (radiyAllahu ‘anhum), that he (ﷺ) said: There is no envy (hasad) except in two cases: a person to whom Allah has granted wisdom, and he rules by this and teaches it to the people, and a person to whom Allah has granted wealth and property and along with this the power to spend it in the cause of Truth.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This being the wording of Ibn Mas‘ud. The wording of Ibn ‘Umar (radiyAllahu ‘anhuma) is, A person to whom Allah has given the Qur'an and he recites it night and day, and a person to whom Allah has granted wealth and property from which he gives in charity night and day.</p>

    <p>Al-Bukhari also reports this hadith from Abi Hurayrah (radiyAllahu ‘anhu) and its wording is, There is no desirable form of jealousy except for two types: a person to whom Allah has given the Quran and he recites it day and night, so when a person hears him he says, "If only I were given the likes of what he has been given so that I may act upon it the way this person is." And a person to whom Allah has bestowed wealth and he spends in the cause of Truth, so a person says, "If only I were given the likes of what he has been given, so that I may act upon it the way this person is."</p>

    <p>So the Prophet (ﷺ) forbade hasad, with the exception of two cases which are referred to as al-ghubta, meaning that a person loves the condition of someone else and dislikes that this person be superior in this way (without his wishing that it be removed from that person).</p>

    <p>So if it is asked: "Then why is this called envy when he loves only that Allah bestows these blessings upon him?" It is said, “The starting point of this love is his looking towards the favors Allah has bestowed upon someone else and his disliking that this person be favored over him. So if this other person were not present then he would not have desired these blessings. So because the starting point of this love is this dislike that someone else be made superior to him, then this is called envy due to the love following the dislike. As for desiring that Allah bestows favors upon him without consideration of people’s material conditions then this is not envy at all.”</p>

    <p>This is why the generality of mankind have been tried with this second type of envy that has also been called al-munafasah (competition) because two people compete in a single desired matter, both of them trying to attain the same good. The reason for their trying to attain it is that one of them dislikes that the other be blessed with this matter over him just as any one of two competitors dislikes the other beating him.</p>

    <p>Competition is not considered blameworthy in general; rather it is considered to be praiseworthy when competing for righteousness, the Exalted said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Indeed the pious will be in delight. On thrones, looking on. You will recognize in their faces the brightness of delight. They will be given to drink pure sealed wine. The last thereof (that wine) will be the smell of Musk, and for this let those compete who want to compete.</p>
        <footer>(Surah al-Mutafifin (83):22-26)</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So one is commanded to compete for these delights and not to compete for the delight of this fleeting world. This is in total agreement with the hadith of the Prophet (ﷺ), for he forbade envy except of the one who has been granted knowledge and he acts according to it and teaches it, and the one who has been bestowed wealth and spends it (in the way of Allah). As for the one who has been granted knowledge but does not act upon this knowledge, or the one who has been bestowed wealth but does not spend this in obedience to Allah, then such a person is not to be envied and neither is his condition to be hoped for, for he is not in a state of good that is desirable; rather he is being presented with punishment. He also allowed jealousy for the one who has been given a responsibility and he fulfills it with knowledge and justice, and fulfills the trusts of its owners, and judges amongst the people by the Qur'an and Sunnah.</p>

    <h2>Between Hasad and Ghubta</h2>

    <p>Fundamentally, envy occurs when someone else attains power and authority; otherwise, the one who is performing actions is not normally envied, even if this person be blessed with far more food, drink and wives than others, as opposed to these two blessings of power and authority, for they cause a great deal of envy. This is why you find envy directed at the People of Knowledge, who have a following amongst the people, that you will not find directed to others who do not have such a following. Similarly for the one who attracts a following due to his spending his wealth, for the people benefit this person by nourishing his heart, and this person brings benefit to them by the nourishment of the bodies. Mankind is in need of that which will correct them in both these matters, this is why Allah, the One free from imperfection, has propounded two parables:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Allah puts forward the example: a slave under the possession of another, he has no power of any sort, and (the other) a man on whom We have bestowed a good provision from Us, and he spends thereof secretly and openly. Could they be equal? (By no means, not). All the praises and thanks be to Allah. Nay! (But) most of them know not. And Allah puts forward another parable of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power over anything, and he is a burden to his master, whichever way he directs him he brings no good. Is such a man equal to one who commands justice, and is himself on the Straight Path?</p>
        <footer>(Surah an-Nahl (16):75-76)</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>These two parables were propounded by Allah for His Own Holy Self and for that which is worshipped besides Him, for indeed the idols are not capable of performing any actions that would be of benefit, and neither of saying anything that would be of benefit. So when a completely powerless slave under the possession of someone is considered, and another to whom Allah has provided a goodly provision from which he spends in secret and in the open, can this slave, incapable of doing good, and this person capable of doing good for the people in secret and open, ever be equal? And He, free is as He from defect, is able to bestow good upon His servants, and as He is continuously doing so.</p>

    <p>So how can this incapable slave (i.e., the idol) who cannot do anything be likened to Allah to the extent that he is worshipped alongside Him? So this is the parable of one to whom Allah has bestowed wealth from which he spends day and night.</p>

    <p>The second parable: when two people are considered, one of them is dumb; he does not understand nor speak, and is not capable of anything and is in fact a burden upon his master, for whichever way he directs him he brings no good and hence he is of absolutely no use. The other is a just scholar - enjoining justice and acting justly, and is upon the Straight Path. This person is then like the one upon whom Allah has conferred wisdom and he acts according to it and teaches it. And Allah has propounded this parable for Himself, for He is All-Knowing, All-Just, All-Powerful, commanding justice. He is maintaining His creation in justice and is upon the Straight Way as He, the Exalted said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Allah bears witness that there is none worthy of worship but He, and the angels, and those having knowledge; (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice. There is none worthy of worship but He, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
        <footer>(Surah Al ‘Imran (3):18)</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And He said upon the tongue of Hud:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Indeed my Lord is upon the Straight Path.</p>
        <footer>(Surah Hud (11):56)</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is why the people used to exalt the home of al-‘Abbas: ‘Abdullah used to teach the people and his brother used to feed them, and so they used to exalt them due to this.</p>

    <p>Mu‘awiyah (radiyAllahu ‘anhu) saw the people asking Ibn ‘Umar about the rites of Hajj and Ibn ‘Umar would give them the verdicts, to which Mu‘awiyah said, “By Allah this is nobility” or something similar.</p>

    <h2>The Competition between as-Siddiq and ‘Umar</h2>

    <p>So here is ‘Umar bin al-Khattab (radiyAllahu ‘anh) competing with Abu Bakr (radiyAllahu ‘anh) with respect to spending in charity as is established in the Sahih (of al-Bukhari) from ‘Umar bin al-Khattab (radiyAllahu ‘anhu), that he said:</p>

    <p>The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) commanded us to give in charity, and this coincided with my possessing some wealth. So I said (to myself): "If there is a day that I can better Abu Bakr than it is this one." So I went with half of my wealth and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked me, "What have you left for your family?" I replied, "The same amount." Then Abu Bakr came with everything that he possessed and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) asked him, "What have you left for your family?" He replied, "I have left Allah and His Messenger for them." So I said, "I will never be able to better you in anything!"</p>

    <p>So what ‘Umar did here was competition and the permitted type of jealousy (ghubta), but the state of as-Siddiq was better than his.</p>
