<h3>Summary of Preceding Text</h3>
<p>The discussion focuses on the concept of healing in the Qur’an and its application to both physical and spiritual ailments. Various verses are presented, highlighting Allah's promise to heal and ease the suffering of believers. For instance, in Surah At-Tawbah (9:14), Allah mentions how He will heal the breast of a believing folk, emphasizing healing as a divine promise for those who have faith. Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:80) similarly states, "And when I become sick, He heals me." These verses suggest that both guidance and physical healing are integral to believers, illustrating a close link between faith and health.</p>
<p>The text further explores the ailments of the heart, drawing attention to spiritual diseases such as hypocrisy and doubt. It cites Surah al-Baqarah (2:10) to highlight how some hold a disease in their hearts, which Allah has increased. The negative impact of these spiritual ailments is examined in how they affect one's perception and desires, skewing one's judgment to the point where they are unable to recognize truth or accept beneficial paths. The authors argue that diseases of the heart can lead individuals towards harmful desires, detracting from their faith and well-being.</p>
<p>In analyzing the nature of sickness, both physical and spiritual, the text articulates a similarity in how both types of ailments can lead to limitations in perception and an overall weakening of strength. Just as physical maladies can manifest through an inability to digest food or extreme sensitivity to environmental conditions, the illnesses of the heart weaken one's resolve and moral clarity. The comparison illustrates how vital it is to remedy both kinds of ailments through guidance from the Qur'an, which offers healing for the soul and directives for maintaining health, encouraging a holistic approach to well-being rooted in spiritual and physical harmony.</p>

<h2>Main Text</h2>
<h1>The Disease of the Body and Heart</h1>
<p>The disease of the body is the opposite of its being sound and in good health. It is a degeneration that occurs in it, causing a failure of the natural senses of perception and movement. In terms of perception, this can manifest as complete loss, such as blindness or deafness, or it can involve incorrect perceptions—such as perceiving something sweet to be bitter or hallucinating things that have no reality in the real world. As for movement, examples include the inability to digest food, aversion to necessary nourishment, or desire for things that weaken the body, resulting in illnesses that may not lead to death or physical ruin.</p>
<p>These failures can lead to suffering of the actual body, either due to consuming the wrong quantity of something or applying something to the body incorrectly. For example, a person might consume too little nourishment, requiring more, or consume too much, necessitating removal. External factors like extremely high or low temperatures due to incorrect usage of medicine can also contribute.</p>
<p>Similarly, the disease of the heart represents a type of degeneration that causes failures in its perception and desires. Its perception can be degraded by doubts until it cannot recognize truth or may perceive it incorrectly. Its desires degrade by hating beneficial truths while loving harmful falsehoods. This is why diseases of the heart have sometimes been described as doubt and suspicion, as mentioned in the verse:</p>
<blockquote>
    "In their hearts is a disease and Allah has increased their disease."  
    <cite>Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 10</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>At other times, it refers to the desire to commit fornication, as noted in the verse:</p>
<blockquote>
    "Lest he in whose heart is a disease be moved with desire."  
    <cite>Surah Al-Ahzab (33): 32</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why al-Khara’iti authored a book titled, “The Book of the Weakness of the Hearts Meaning their Diseases,” referring to the diseases of desire.</p>
<p>The sick person suffers from things that do not affect a healthy person; slight heat, cold, or exertion may harm him due to his inability to endure them in a weakened state. Generally, sickness weakens the afflicted person, diminishing his endurance. A healthy state is preserved by remaining healthy and is removed by its opposite. Similarly, sickness becomes more severe when exposed to conditions similar to those that caused the original sickness and is alleviated by their opposites. Hence, if a sick person is subjected to something akin to his original ailment, his illness may worsen and endurance may weaken, potentially leading to death. Conversely, if he encounters something that boosts his strength, the opposite will occur.</p>
<p>The disease of the heart can manifest as pain caused by anger towards an opponent who has wronged you. Allah, the Exalted, said:</p>
<blockquote>
    "...and heal the breast of a believing people and removes the anger of their hearts..."  
    <cite>Surah At-Tawbah (9): 14-15</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, healing for them involves alleviating the suffering experienced in their hearts. It is expressed that someone "has healed his anger." In terms of retaliation, it is said: "The close relatives of the killed sought healing," referring to the healing of their grief, anger, and sorrow—all forms of suffering within oneself. Likewise, doubt and ignorance induce pain in the heart. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
    "Could they not have asked if they did not know? Indeed, the cure for ignorance is to ask."
</blockquote>
<p>A person plagued by doubt harms his heart until he achieves knowledge and certainty. Therefore, when a scholar answers in a way that clarifies the truth, it is said to him, "You have healed me with your answer."</p>

<h1>Between Sickness and Death</h1>
<p>Sickness is a lesser state than death; the heart dies from complete ignorance but becomes ill from fragments of ignorance. In this case, the heart can experience death, sickness, or healing. The life, death, sickness, and cure of the heart are more significant and vital than those of the body. This is why the heart becomes sick when troubled by doubts and desires or when its sickness intensifies. Wisdom and goodly exhortation are pathways to its correction and cure.</p>
<p>Allah, the Most High, says:</p>
<blockquote>
    "That He may make what is thrown in by Satan a trial for those whose hearts are hardened."  
    <cite>Surah Al-Hajj (22): 53</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>This breeds doubts in their hearts, hardening them through spiritual dryness, while they become weakened by doubt and distance themselves from faith, making the whispers of Satan a trial for them.</p> 
<p>Allah continues:</p>
<blockquote>
    "If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease cease not, we shall certainly let you overpower them; then they will not be able to dwell among you as your neighbors but for a little while."  
    <cite>Surah Al-Ahzab (33): 60</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
    "...and that no doubts may be left for the People of the Book and the believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the disbelievers may say: 'What does Allah intend by this parable?'"  
    <cite>Surah Al-Muddaththir (74): 31</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>These people have not achieved the death of disbelief but neither do their hearts reflect the purity of genuine believers. Instead, they harbor the illness of doubt and desire.</p>

<h1>The Qur'an is a Cure for the Hearts</h1>
<p>The Qur'an serves as a remedy for what resides within the heart, especially for those afflicted by doubt and desire. It contains clear proofs that differentiate truth from falsehood and eradicates the sickness of false doubts, leading to certain knowledge, correct perception, and understanding. Consequently, the heart perceives things as they are. It offers wisdom and exhortations encouraging good while deterring from evil. Its narratives convey lessons that guide the correction of the heart, making it yearn for the beneficial and disdain what harms it. Thus, the heart transitions from yearning for deviances to desiring guidance.</p>
<p>The Qur'an eradicates all ailments that incite false desires until the heart attains purity, leading to pure desires and a return to its natural state (fitrah). Likewise, as the body regains its natural state following treatment, the heart can be nurtured through faith and the Qur'an—making it strong, for the heart’s purification parallels the body’s growth.</p>

<h1>Righteous Actions are a Cure for the Heart</h1>
<p>Zakah (purification) linguistically refers to growth and improvement; it is said that "something has zakah" when it has grown better. The heart must be nurtured to mature and achieve fullness, much like the body needs nourishment. Preventative measures against harm are essential. The body will not thrive without beneficial intake and avoidance of harm; likewise, the heart will not achieve purity and grow until it obtains what is beneficial and abstains from harmful influences—akin to how a flower will not flourish without such care.</p>
<p>Sadakah (charity) extinguishes sins just as water extinguishes fire, thus purifying the heart. Its zakah signifies more than mere freedom from sin.</p>
<p>Allah the Exalted said:</p>
<blockquote>
    "Take zakah from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it."  
    <cite>Surah At-Tawbah (9): 103</cite>
</blockquote>

<h1>Leaving Indecent Actions are a Cure for the Heart</h1>
<p>Abstaining from indecent actions and sins is crucial for the heart's purification, similar to how leprosy in the body or thorns on a flower must be removed. When the body is cleansed of leprosy (for instance, through bloodletting), its strength can emerge and promote growth. In parallel, repentance from sin releases the heart from contamination, allowing it to unburden itself from mingling righteous and sinful actions. When one repents, the heart regains strength and the desire to perform good deeds, finding relief from corrupt matters that once afflicted it.</p>
<p>Thus, the health of the heart relates to its growth and completeness. Allah the Exalted said:</p>
<blockquote>
    "And had it not been for the Grace of Allah and His Mercy upon you, not one of you would have ever been pure from sins..."  
    <cite>Surah An-Nur (24): 21</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "And if you are asked to go back, then go back, for it is purer for you..."  
    <cite>Surah An-Nur (24): 28</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and protect their private parts. That is purer for them..."  
    <cite>Surah An-Nur (24): 30</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Indeed, whoever purifies himself will achieve success, and remembers the Name of his Lord and prays."  
    <cite>Surah Al-A‘la (87): 14-15</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Indeed, he succeeds who purifies himself, and indeed he fails who corrupts his self."  
    <cite>Surah Ash-Shams (91): 9-10</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "But what could tell you that perhaps he might become pure?"  
    <cite>Surah Abasa (80): 3</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "And say to him (i.e., Fir‘aun); ‘Would you purify yourself, and that I guide you to your Lord so you should fear Him?’"  
    <cite>Surah An-Nazi'at (79): 18-19</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, tazkiyah (purification), while fundamentally indicating growth, blessing, and increase in goodness, can only be accomplished through the elimination of evil. This is why purification necessitates both performing good deeds and avoiding wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Allah the Most High said:</p>
<blockquote>
    "And woe to the polytheists, those who do not give the zakah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter."  
    <cite>Surah Fussilat (41): 6-7</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, zakah encompasses both tawhid and iman, which together purify the heart. True tawhid entails negating any divine authority besides Allah while affirming Allah’s Lordship within one’s heart—the essence of "La ilaha illallah" (there is none worthy of worship except Allah).</p>
<p>Tazkiyah (purification) signifies acts of making something pure, whether in essence, in faith, or in narrative. It is similarly said, ‘adil’ when one acts justly, both in reality and in perception by others.</p>
<p>Allah, the Most High, said:</p>
<blockquote>
    "So do not ascribe purity (tazkiyah) to yourselves..."  
    <cite>Surah An-Najm (53): 32</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>This admonition directs believers not to claim purity recklessly, in contrast to His declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
    "Indeed, he succeeds who purifies himself."  
    <cite>Surah Ash-Shams (91): 9</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>This distinction underscores the reality that Allah knows best who truly fears Him, as stated:</p>
<blockquote>
    "He knows best who fears Allah."  
    <cite>Surah An-Najm (53): 32</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Zaynab was initially recognized as Burra, as it is said she purified herself, which is why the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) renamed her Zaynab. Meanwhile, Allah's statement:</p>
<blockquote>
    "Have you not seen those who claim purity for themselves? Nay, Allah purifies (yuzakki) whom He pleases."  
    <cite>Surah An-Nisa’ (4): 49</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Affirms that He makes pure whoever He wills and declare their purity, much like the purifier only certifies those whose justice he can attest to.</p>

<h1>The Effect of Sins Upon the Purity of the Heart</h1>
<p>‘Adl (justice) represents balance, and equilibrium signifies the correctness of the heart; in contrast, ghulm (oppression) leads to its corruption. Each sin committed by an individual signifies oppression of the self (zhālim li nafsihi). The opposite of ghulm is ‘adl, which illustrates that the sinner is both the oppressor and the one wronged. Therefore, when one oppresses themselves through sin, they are simultaneously both the perpetrator and the victim. In contrast, rectitude fosters wellbeing while oppression deteriorates it.</p>
