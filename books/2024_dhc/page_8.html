<h4>Summary of Preceding Text</h4>
<p>
    The text discusses the importance of brotherhood among Muslims, emphasizing the prohibition of disassociating from fellow believers for more than three days. It highlights that the best among them is the one who initiates the salam (greetings). The lessons are derived from various hadith, such as one stating that true belief is reflected in loving for one’s brother what one loves for oneself. This interconnectedness is further emphasized with references to the consequences of those who linger behind during communal duties, illustrating that a lack of empathy and joy for others’ blessings indicates a deficiency in faith and love for Allah and His Messenger.
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, the relationship among believers is compared to a single body; if one part suffers, the entire body is affected. This illustration serves to reinforce the notion of mutual support and compassion. Hadith traditions illustrate how the Muslim community should respond to one another's successes and hardships with love and care, underscoring that true believers experience emotional unity through their shared connections in faith. The text warns against negative traits such as jealousy and miserliness, which can lead to detrimental attitudes in communal life, highlighting the destructive nature of jealousy by likening its effects to that of fire consuming wood.
</p>
<p>
    The discussion transitions to the broader psychological aspects of desires, miserliness, and jealousy, characterizing them as ailments of the heart and soul. Passionate love is identified as a psychological sickness that leads individuals to desire harmful things while rejecting beneficial ones. Ultimately, the text conveys a profound concern for ensuring that Muslims maintain healthy relationships rooted in love and mutual support, while also addressing how personal vices can undermine spiritual and communal harmony. The danger posed by greed and jealousy not only affects one's spiritual state but can also disrupt social ties and collective well-being.
</p>

<h1>The Disease of Desires and Passionate Love</h1>

<h2>3.1 Between Jealousy and Desires</h2>
<p>
    Miserliness and jealousy are sicknesses that lead the soul to hate that which would benefit it and to love that which would harm it. This is why jealousy was mentioned alongside hatred and resentment in the preceding ahadith. As for the sickness of desire and passionate love, this is the soul loving that which would harm it, coupled with its hatred of that which would benefit it.
</p>
<p>
    Passionate love is a psychological sickness, and when its effects become noticeable on the body, it manifests as an affliction of the mind as well. This may result in melancholy or physical weakness and emaciation. However, the focus here is to discuss its effect on the heart. Passionate love is the fundament that makes the soul covet that which would harm it, similar to a weakened body that covets what is harmful. If the craving is not satiated, grief ensues, and when it is satiated, the sickness only increases.
</p>

<h2>3.2 The Reality of Passionate Love</h2>
<p>
    The same applies to a heart afflicted with this love: it suffers from its connection to the loved one, whether through seeing, touching, hearing, or even thinking about them. If one attempts to curb this love, their heart feels hurt and grieved; if they give in to the desire, the sickness only strengthens and intensifies their grief.
</p>
<p>
    In the hadith, it is mentioned:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Indeed Allah shelters His believing servant from the world just as one of you shelters your sick ones from food and drink that would harm them."
</blockquote>
<p>
    In the hadith concerning the trials of Misa, reported by Wahb, which is recorded by Imam Ahmad in az-Zuhd, Allah says: "Indeed I drive away My friends from the delights of this world and its opulence just as the compassionate shepherd drives away his camel from dangerous grazing lands. And indeed I make them avoid its tranquility and sustenance, just as the compassionate shepherd makes his camel avoid resting places that are easy prey. This is not because I consider them insignificant, but so that they may complete their portion of My Kindness in safety and abundance."
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, the only cure for a sick heart lies in removing this blameworthy love from within.
</p>
<p>
    People are divided into two opinions concerning passionate love: one group considers it to be within the realm of intentions and wishes, which is the popular opinion. Another group argues that it falls into the realm of imagination and fantasies, indicating a corruption of the imagination, as it leads one to depict the loved one outside their true reality. They state that this is why Allah has not been described with passionate love, since He is far removed from this, and no one can be praised for harboring such corrupt thoughts.
</p>
<p>
    For the first group, there are those who say that Allah is described with passionate love because it represents a complete and perfect love. It is reported in the narration of Abdul Wahid bin Zayd:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "The servant will continue to draw closer to Me, loving Me and I loving him."
</blockquote>
<p>
    This notion is held by some of the Sufis, but the majority do not apply this term to Allah, as passionate love exceeds proper bounds, whereas Allah's love is infinite and cannot exceed what is appropriate. Passionate love is considered blameworthy without exception, whether directed towards the Creator or created beings, as it is a love that exceeds the proper bounds.
</p>
<p>
    The term "passionate love" is typically associated with romantic affection between people, not used for familial love, property, status, or even the love for Prophets and the righteous. Commonly, this term appears in conjunction with forbidden actions, such as loving an impermissible partner or harboring desires that lead to unlawful acts.
</p>
<p>
    For one who loves a permissible partner to the extent that they act outside the parameters of justice, it can lead to disastrous consequences, such as neglecting the rights of their first wife or even acting detrimentally to their religious and worldly obligations. This passionate love may lead one to do things that harm their spiritual and worldly life, such as unjustly allocating inheritance or giving excessive authority and property to someone not deserving of it.
</p>

<h2>3.3 The Natural Inclination of the Heart is to Love of Allah</h2>
<p>
    The heart was created solely for the worship of Allah, following the natural disposition (fitrah) upon which Allah created His servants. As the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Every newborn child is born upon the natural disposition; it is his parents that make him a Jew, Christian, or Magian, just as an animal produces a perfect young one. Do you see any part of its body amputated?"
</blockquote>
<p>
    Abi Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned that we should recite the saying of Allah:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "The Fitrah of Allah with which He has created mankind. No change is there in the creation of Allah."
</blockquote>
<p>
    Hence, Allah has endowed His servants with a natural disposition to love and worship Him Alone. If this disposition were left uncorrupted, it would naturally acknowledge and love Allah. However, this disposition can become corrupted due to the ailments of the heart, as when parents lead a child into Judaism or Christianity. Despite this, it is possible for the heart to return to its original disposition if Allah facilitates this return.
</p>
<p>
    The Messengers were sent to confirm and restore this natural disposition, not to alter it. When the heart loves Allah Alone, making the religion sincere for Him, it will not be tempted to love anyone else, let alone succumb to passionate love. This is why, when Yūsuf faced passionate love, his devotion to Allah prevented him from being overtaken by it. Allah affirmed:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "Thus it was, that We might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse. Surely he was one of Our chosen, guided servants."
</blockquote>
<p>
    In contrast, the wife of al-‘Aziz was driven to passionate love due to her and her nation's polytheism. No one falls into passionate love without it diminishing their exclusive worship of Allah and faith. A heart that repents to Allah in fear has two avenues for removing passionate love:
</p>

<h2>3.4 Preventative Measures from Passionate Love</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Repent to Allah and love Him:</strong> Indeed, this love is more fulfilling and pure than any other; nothing will remain to love alongside Allah.</li>
    <li><strong>Fear Allah:</strong> Fear is the antithesis of passionate love and serves to eliminate it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Thus, anyone who loves something, whether passionately or not, can remove that love by cultivating a deeper love for that which is more beloved than the object of their passion. The fear of a greater harm can also serve to diminish this love. When Allah is loved more than anything else and feared more than anything else, one will not succumb to passionate love or find competitors for their love for Allah, except in moments of negligence or weakness brought on by neglecting obligations or engaging in prohibited actions. Faith increases with obedience and diminishes with disobedience; each time a servant obeys Allah out of love and fear, the bond becomes stronger.
