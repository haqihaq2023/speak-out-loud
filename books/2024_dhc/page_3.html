    <h4>Summary of Preceeding Text</h4>
    <p>The concepts of purification and the consequences of sin on the heart are extensively elaborated in the text, highlighting the connection between faith, good deeds, and the state of one's heart. The idea of tazkiyyah, or purification, is emphasized not merely as an act of avoidance of evil but also as a means to enhance the heart's strength and its drive towards righteous actions. Key verses from the Qur'an, such as those from Surah At-Tawbah (9:103) and Surah Ash-Shams (91:9-10), remind believers that purity comes from both actions and intentions, reclaiming the heart from the contamination of sins and indecent behavior.</p>

    <p>The text explains that the heart can either thrive or suffer due to its intrinsic relationship with one's actions. Acts of repentance lead to a release from spiritual contamination, analogous to physical ailments being expunged from the body for recovery. Purity, according to the definitions drawn from the Qur'an, pertains to aligning oneself with Allah's will, encapsulated not only in notions of worship but in genuine self-awareness and avoidance of arrogance in one's perceived purity. Allah's declarations about the nature of purification serve as a reminder that it is He who grants purity to those He chooses, as referenced in Surah An-Nisa (4:49).</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the relationship between justice and balance is highlighted as essential to the condition of the heart. When a person commits sins, they oppress their own self, leading to an imbalance that disrupts the natural order of justice within their soul. Conversely, righteous actions not only uplift the self but also enhance one's standing in both spiritual and material dimensions. This interplay of actions and their effects provides a framework through which believers can navigate their lives, ensuring that every deed is purposed toward the cultivation of a sound heart. The impact of actions, as illustrated in the verses cited, reinforces the belief that good deeds illuminate the heart and foster peace, while sins create shadows and unrest.</p>

    <h1>Healing of the Heart</h1>

    <p class="verse">He succeeds who purifies himself.<br>[Surah ash-Shams (91): 9]</p>

    <p>This is why Allah, the Most High, said,<br>
    <span class="verse">He knows best who fears Allah.<br>[Surah An-Najm (53): 32]</span></p>

    <p>Zaynab was initially known as Burra, and it is said that she purified herself, which is why the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called her Zaynab. As for the saying of Allah,<br>
    <span class="verse">Have you not seen those who claim purity for themselves? Nay, but Allah purifies (yuzakki) whom He pleases.<br>[Surah An-Nisa (4): 49]</span></p>

    <p>This means He makes pure whomsoever He pleases and makes his purity known, just as the purifier declares to be pure only those whose justice he can bear testimony to.</p>

    <h2>The Effect of Sins Upon the Purity of the Heart</h2>

    <p>‘Adl (fairness and justice) is ‘adl (balance), and in balance lies the correction of the heart, just as in zulm (imbalance/oppression) lies its corruption. This is why for every sin that a person has committed, he has oppressed himself (zhaliman li nafsihi). The opposite of zulm is ‘adl, so this sinful person has not been just to himself; rather, he has oppressed it. The correction of the heart lies in ‘adl and its corruption lies in zulm. Therefore, when the servant oppresses himself, he is both the oppressor and the oppressed at the same time; likewise, when he is just, he is the one who is just and the one upon whom the justice is carried out.</p>

    <p>The person does an action, and he will receive the fruit of this action, be it bitter or sweet.</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah said,<br>
    ...He has the reward for the (good) that he has earned, and he is punished for the (evil) which he has earned...<br>[Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 286]</p>

    <p>‘Aml (actions) have an effect upon the heart, either of benefit, harm, or correction, before they affect the external body. The good and pure actions constitute justice for the soul, whereas bad actions oppress the soul.</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah, the Most High, said,<br>
    Whoever does righteous deeds, it is for the (benefit of) himself, and whosoever does evil, it is against his own self.<br>[Surah Fussilat (41): 46]</p>

    <p>If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil, you do it against yourselves.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-Isra (17): 7]</span></p>

    <p>Some of the Salaf said, ‘Indeed good actions are a light in the heart, a strengthening for the body, a glow on the face, a cause for extensive provisions and love in the hearts of the creation. Indeed bad actions are a darkness in the heart, a blackness on the face, a weakness for the body, a cause for decrease in provisions and hatred in the hearts of the creation.’</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah, the Most High, said,<br>
    Every person has a pledge for that which he has earned.<br>[Surah At-Tur (52): 21]</p>

    <p>Every person has a pledge for what he has earned.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-Muddaththir (74): 38]</span></p>

    <p>But remind (them) of it (the Qur'an) lest a person be given up to destruction for that which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides Allah. And even if he offers every ransom, it will not be accepted from him. Such are they who are given up to destruction because of that which they earned.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-An'am (6): 70]</span></p>

    <p>Tubsala means to repress, to fetter and captivate.</p>

    <p>Similarly, when the body has recovered from illness, it is said: ‘He has balanced his temperament and disposition.’ This is because the sickness distorts the temperament, despite the fact that there is no way to achieve complete balance, safe from mixing both justice and injustice - but the ideal, or close to the ideal, should be aimed for.</p>

    <p>The same case applies to the heart; its health and correction lie in balance, and its sickness lies in deviation, oppression, and digression. But complete balance in everything is impossible, in action or knowledge - the ideal, or the closest to the ideal, should be aimed for. This is why it is said, describing the Salaf way: ‘the ideal way.’</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah said,<br>
    And you will never be able to be just between the wives, even if you desire to be...<br>[Surah An-Nisa (4): 129]</p>

    <p>And give full measure and full weight. We do not burden a soul beyond what it can bear.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-An'am (6): 152]</span></p>

    <p>Allah, the Exalted, sent the messengers and revealed the Books so that man may establish justice, and the greatest form of justice is to worship Allah alone with no partner; then giving due justice to the rights of man; then being just upon oneself.</p>

    <h2>Types of Zulm</h2>

    <p>Zulm is of three types, and all of these are from the sicknesses of the heart, and in justice lies its good health and purity. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said to one of the people, ‘If you were healthy, you would not fear anyone,’ meaning that the fear you have of men is due to a sickness from within you, such as the sickness of shirk and sins.</p>

    <p>The basis of the heart being corrected lies in it being alive and enlightened.</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah, the Most High, said,<br>
    Is he who was dead and We gave him life and set for him a light whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who is in the darkness of disbelief from which he can never come?<br>[Surah Al-An'am (6): 122]</p>

    <p>This is why Allah has mentioned the life of the heart, its illumination, death, and darkness in several places, like His, the Exalted’s saying,<br>
    <span class="verse">That he may give warning to he who is alive.<br>[Surah Ya-Sin (36): 70]</span></p>

    <p>O you who believe! Answer the call of Allah and His Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life, and know that Allah comes in between a person and his heart. And verily to Him, you shall be gathered.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-Anfal (8): 24]</span></p>

    <p>He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Ar-Rum (30): 19]</span></p>

    <p>From the examples of this is His bringing forth a believer from a disbeliever, and a disbeliever from a believer.</p>

    <p>In the authentic Hadith,<br>
    The similitude of a house in which Allah is mentioned and the house in which Allah is not mentioned is as the living and the dead.</p>

    <p>In Sahih (al-Bukhari), it is reported,<br>
    Perform some of your prayers in your houses, and do not take them as graves.</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah, the Most High, has said,<br>
    Those who reject our signs are deaf, dumb, and in darkness.<br>[Surah Al-An'am (6): 39]</p>

    <p>Allah has mentioned the ‘Verse of Light’ and the ‘Verse of Darkness’ saying,<br>
    <span class="verse">Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp is in the glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east nor west, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light!<br>[Surah An-Nur (24): 35]</span></p>

    <p>This is the similitude for the light of faith in the hearts of the believers. Then He said, as for those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing, but he finds Allah with him, Who will pay his due (in Hell). And Allah is Swift in taking account. Or (the state of the disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed with a great wave, topped by dark clouds - darkness one above another - if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, there is no light.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah An-Nur (24): 39-40]</span></p>

    <p>So the first verse sets forth a similitude for the false beliefs and the actions that arise from these beliefs, one considers them to be something of benefit, but when they come to him (on the Day of Judgment) he will not find any benefit in them at all. Rather Allah will fully give him his recompense for these actions (in Hell). The second verse is the similitude propounded for extensive ignorance, lack of faith, and correct knowledge. The person who possesses these is in darkness, one above another, unable to see anything, for indeed sight occurs only with the light of faith and correct knowledge.</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah, the Most High, said,<br>
    Indeed, those who are pious, when an evil thought comes to them from Satan, they remember (Allah), and they then see (aright).<br>[Surah Al-A'raf (7): 201]</p>

    <p>And indeed she did desire him and he (Yusuf) would have inclined to her desire, had he not seen the evidence of his Lord.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Yusuf (12): 24]</span></p>

    <p>This means the proof of faith which his heart had attained, so due to this Allah caused him to turn away from that which he was inclined to, and recorded for him a complete good deed, and no sin was recorded against him due to his having performed a good action and not performed an evil one.</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah, the Exalted said,<br>
    In order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light...<br>[Surah Ibrahim (14): 1]</p>

    <p>Allah is the Protector of those who believe. He brings them out from the darkness into the light. But as for those who disbelieve, their protectors are false deities; they bring them out from the light into the darkness.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 257]</span></p>

    <p>O you who believe (in Moses and Jesus)! Fear Allah and believe in His Messenger, He will give you a double portion of His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk straight...<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-Hadid (57): 28]</span></p>

    <p>This is why Allah has propounded two types of parables for faith: a parable of water by which life exists and the foam that comes with it; and a parable of fire by which light is produced.</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah said,<br>
    He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and the valleys flow according to their measure, but the floods bear away the foam that mounts up on the surface, and also from that (ore) which they heat in the fire in order to make ornaments or utensils, rises a foam like unto it; thus does Allah (by parables) show forth truth from falsehood...<br>[Surah Ar-Ra'd (13): 17]</p>

    <p>Similarly, Allah has propounded two parables for hypocrisy,<br>
    Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness so they could not see. They are deaf, dumb, and blind - so they will not return (to the Right Path). Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder, and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers. The lightning almost snatches away their sight; whenever it flashes for them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah has power over all things.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 17-20]</span></p>

    <p>So He propounded a parable for them with one who kindled a fire; each time it ignited, Allah caused it to extinguish, and the parable of water in which the water is sent down containing darkness, thunder, and lightning - this is not the place for a detailed explanation of these parables for the purpose here is only to mention the life of the heart and its illumination.</p>

    <h2>The Life of the Heart</h2>

    <p>In the narrated du'a there occurs,<br>
    <span class="verse">Make the Qur'an the nurturer (rab) of our hearts and the light of our chest.</span></p>

    <p>Rabi' means the rain that descends from the sky and nourishes the plants. The Arabs call the season in which the rain first descends al-Rabi' due to the fall of rain which causes growth (of produce). The non-Arabs call the season that follows winter al-Rabi' because in this season the plants from which fruit is produced blossom and the leaves on the trees appear.</p>

    <h2>The State of the Dead Heart</h2>

    <p>The heart that is alive and enlightened hears, sees, and understands due to the light that it contains, while the dead heart does not hear, see, or understand.</p>

    <p class="verse">Allah, the Exalted said,<br>
    The example of those who disbelieve is as that of him who shouts to the (flock of sheep) that hears nothing but calls and cries. (They are) deaf, dumb and blind.<br>[Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 171]</p>

    <p>And among them are some who listen to you, but can you make the deaf hear, even though they comprehend not? And among them are some who look at you, but can you guide the blind, even though they see not?<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Yunus (10): 42-43]</span></p>

    <p>And among them are some who listen to you; but We have set veils on their hearts, so they understand it not, and deafness in their ears; if they see every one of the signs they will not believe therein, to the point that when they come to argue with you, the disbelievers say: “These are nothing but tales of the men of old.”<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-An'am (6): 25]</span></p>

    <p>So He informed us that their hearts cannot understand, and their ears cannot hear, and they do not believe in what they have seen of the Fire as He informed us about them when He said,<br>
    And they say: 'Our hearts are under coverings from that which you invite us to, and in our ears is deafness, and between us and you is a screen.'<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Fussilat (41): 5]</span></p>

    <p>So they mentioned the barriers upon their hearts, ears, and eyes. Their bodies are alive - hearing and seeing, but this is a life of the body devoid of life in the heart - like the life of an animal - for the animals possess hearing and seeing, and eat and drink and marry.</p>

    <p>This is why Allah said,<br>
    The example of those who disbelieve is as that of him who shouts to the (flock of sheep) that hears nothing but calls and cries.<br>
    <span class="verse">[Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 171]</span></p>

    <p>Likening them to the cattle, at whom the shepherd shouts, and they hear nothing except the cry (not understanding what is said), as He said in other verses.</p>
