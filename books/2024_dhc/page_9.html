    <h4>Summary of Preceding Text</h4>
    <p>The discussion centers around the concept of the heart's ailments, emphasizing that many sins originate from internal sicknesses, particularly envy and desires that lead to harmful actions. The narrative illustrates how a person's love can become tainted by negative emotions, such as hatred, illustrating this through a poetic analogy of an individual's irrational love for a specific culture because of personal infatuation. The author underscores the importance of seeking divine assistance to cleanse one's heart from such ill feelings, expressing a desire for purity and a return to one's innate disposition towards goodness.</p>

    <p>The text also delves into the natural inclination (firah) of the heart, which is created inherently to worship Allah. The Prophet's teachings are referenced to reinforce that every child is born with this pure disposition, but external influences can corrupt it over time. The discussion acknowledges that although individuals may stray towards misguided beliefs, it remains possible to return to the original state through sincere repentance and striving toward righteousness. The Messengers were sent to reaffirm this natural disposition and guide individuals back to worshiping Allah alone, free from distractions or passionate attachments that could diminish their faith.</p>

    <p>Preventative measures against passionate love—defined as a deeper emotional connection that can lead one astray—are also outlined. Repentance and cultivating love for Allah are presented as essential strategies to combat such distractions. The text asserts that a heart that ardently loves and fears Allah will not succumb to competing affections, highlighting the need for obedience and avoidance of sin as pivotal in strengthening one's faith. The significance of nurturing the heart through prayer, supplication, and reflection upon the Qur'an is mentioned as instrumental in both healing and sustaining its faith, thus encouraging individuals to engage in righteous deeds to preserve their spiritual well-being.</p>
    
    <h4>Main Text</h4>
    <strong>Preventative Measures from Passionate Love</strong>
    <p>No one is afflicted with passionate love except that this diminishes his singling out Allah Alone for worship and his faith. The heart that repents to Allah, fearing Him, has two routes by which it can remove this passionate love:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Repenting to Allah and loving Him, for indeed this is more satisfying and purer than anything else, and nothing will be left to love alongside Allah.</li>
        <li>Fearing Allah, for indeed fear is the opposite of passionate love and removes it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So everyone who loves something, with passion or otherwise, can have this love removed by loving that which is more beloved to compete with it. This love can also be removed by fearing the occurrence of a harm that is more hateful to one than leaving this love. So when Allah is more beloved to the servant than anything else, and more feared by him than anything else, then he will not fall into passionate love or find any love that would compete with his love of Allah, except in the case of negligence or at a time when this love and fear has become weak due to leaving some of the obligatory duties and performing some of the prohibited actions. For indeed, faith increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience. Thus, each time a servant obeys Allah out of love and fear, and leaves a prohibited action out of love and fear, his love and fear become stronger, and any love or fear of anything else besides Allah will disappear from his heart.</p>

    <p>Refer to Randah al-Mubibbin of Ibn al-Qayyim for he has a beautiful discussion concerning this.</p>

    <strong>Some Cures for the Heart</strong>
    <p>The same is true for the sickness of the body: for the health of the body is preserved by the same, and the sickness is repressed by the opposite. The correctness of faith in the heart is preserved by its like, meaning that which would breed faith in the heart from the beneficial knowledge and righteous action; for these are its nourishment as occurs in the hadith of Ibn Mas‘ud, reported as his saying and as a hadith of the Messenger (peace be upon him):</p>

    <blockquote>“Indeed, every host loves that people come to his table spread, and indeed the table spread of Allah is the Qur'an.”</blockquote>

    <p>So the Qur'an is the table spread of Allah.</p>

    <p>From those things that nourish the heart are supplication at the end of the night, the times of Adhan and Iqamah, in his prostration, at the ends of the prayers - add to this repentance. For indeed the one who repents to Allah and then in turn Allah forgives him, He will then give him enjoyment for an appointed time. This includes reciting the reported adhkar for the day and at the time he sleeps. He should bear with patience what he is enticed with that would divert him from all of this, for Allah will immediately aid him with a spirit from Him and write faith in his heart. He should be eager to complete the obligatory duties such as the five prayers inwardly and outwardly, for they are the pillars of the religion. His words of recourse should be:</p>

    <blockquote>“A hawla wa la quwwata illa billah”</blockquote>

    <p>For by them, heavy burdens can be borne, horrors can be overcome, and the servant can be gifted with the best of conditions to live in. He should not give up the supplication and seeking help from Allah, for the servant will be answered as long as he is not hasty, saying, “I have supplicated and supplicated but I have not been answered.”</p>

    <p>He should know that help comes with patience, that relief comes after anxiety and distress, that after every period of difficulty, there follows a period of ease. He should also know that no prophet or one less than him was rewarded with a good end except as a result of his being patient.</p>

    <p>And all praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Lord of Creation. To Him belongs praise and grace for guiding us to Islam and the Sunnah, a praise that would suffice His favours to us outwardly and inwardly, as is required for the nobility of His Face and might of His Magnificence. Abundant peace and blessings be upon our master, Muhammad (peace be upon him), and upon his family, companions, his wives - the mothers of the believers, and all those that follow them in good until the Day of Judgement.</p>

    <strong>Appendix: The Types of Hearts</strong>
    <p>Because the heart is described as possessing life or death, it is classified into three types:</p>

    <strong>The Correct and Sound Heart</strong>
    <p>This is the truthful and sound (salim) heart. It is the only type of heart that a person can bring to Allah on the Day of Judgment which will rescue him. Allah, Exalted is He, says:</p>

    <blockquote>“…the Day when neither wealth nor sons will be of any use - except for he who comes to Allah with a sound and flawless heart.”<br>(ash-Shu'ara (26): 88-89)</blockquote>

    <p>The meaning of salim (secure) is salim (the one who is secure); it has come in this form because it depicts an innate attribute or description of the described. As such, it is grammatically like the words tall (qawi), short (qasir), or graceful and charming (jamil).</p>

    <p>Therefore, the one whose heart is described as salim is characterized as such because this attribute of truthfulness and soundness has become its constant and established quality. In this respect, it is like the terms, “the one who knows” (alim) and “the one who has power” (qadir).</p>

    <p>It is also the opposite of diseased (marid), sick (sagim), and ailing (alim).</p>

    <p>People have described the sound and truthful heart in different ways. However, they all revolve around the following basic concept:</p>

    <p>The truthful and sound heart is that which is secure from every carnal desire that opposes the order and prohibition of Allah. It is secure from every doubt and uncertainty that would obscure or go against His narrative. It is secure from displaying servitude to any other than Him; just as it is secure from seeking ruling from any other than His Messenger. Therefore, it becomes sound through loving Allah and seeking the ruling of His Messenger. It becomes sound through showing Him fear, hope, trust, reliance, penitence, and humility; it prefers what pleases Him in every circumstance and distances itself from everything that would displease Him in every possible way. This is the reality of servitude (‘ubudiyyah) which can only be directed to Allah Alone.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the truthful and sound heart is that heart which is secure from committing any form of shirk whatsoever and instead its servitude is directed only to, and purely for, Allah, Exalted is He. Its desire, love, trust, reliance, penitence, humility, fear, and hope are only for Allah and its actions are purely for His sake. Hence if it loves, it loves for the sake of Allah; if it hates, it hates for the sake of Allah; if it gives, it gives for the sake of Allah; and if it withholds, it withholds for the sake of Allah.</p>

    <p>But this alone does not suffice until the heart becomes secure from submitting to, and going to anybody else but, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) for judgement. Therefore, the heart ties a firm bond with him (peace be upon him), resolving to follow him and obey him alone in sayings and actions. These sayings comprise the saying of the heart: the matters of belief; and the sayings of the tongue which convey what the heart contains. These actions comprise the actions of the heart: its desire, love, dislike, and other connected matters; and the actions of the limbs.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the judge for all these matters - the major and minor of them - is that which the Messenger (peace be upon him) came with. Hence, the heart does not put itself before...</p>
