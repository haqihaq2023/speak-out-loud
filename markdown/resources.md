- [Clean-Mushaf](https://github.com/haqihaq2023/Clean-Mushaf): I like having a mushaf on my phone. There's lots of great Quran apps out there, but I find it's hard to mark up the text, for example to highlight pronunciation mistakes. The solution: download this very high-resolution Quran onto your smartphone and annotate it on a PDF app. See the link for an app recommendation.
