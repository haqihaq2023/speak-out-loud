## Books

#### [Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum (The Sealed Nectar)](https://haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/books/2024_sn/index.html)
*1976, Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri. Originally in Arabic, Urdu*. A prize-winning seerah (biography of the Prophet Muhammad (p)), now seen as a modern classic. I thank the Halton Islamic Association for recommending the book!
> The Prophet Muhammad (S) said: "The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth. Some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain-water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain-water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, (making their animals drink from it) and to irrigate the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's Religion (Islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah (Azawajal) has revealed through me (the Prophet ) and learns and then teaches it to others. The (last example is that of a) person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's Guidance revealed through me (he is like that barren land)." (Al-Mukarramah)

#### [Diseases of the Hearts & Their Cures](https://haqihaq2023.github.io/speak-out-loud/books/2024_dhc/index.html)
*Compilation of Ibn Taymiyyah by Shaykhul-Islam. Translation by Abu Rumaysah*. A concise work that brings together pieces of the Quran and the Hadiths on how to align one's inner life with the sunnah. Great to read often.
> Actions are distinguished, one from the other, with respect to their excellence in the Sight of Allah in accordance with the condition of the heart, not by their number or form, but rather due to the strength of the caller, his truthfulness, his sincerity and the extent to which he prefer Allah over himself.
